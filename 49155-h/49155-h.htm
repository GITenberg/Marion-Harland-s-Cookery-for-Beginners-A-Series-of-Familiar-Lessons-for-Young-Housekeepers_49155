<h2>COOKERY FOR BEGINNERS.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>1<br />

<small>HOME-MADE YEAST AND THE FIRST LOAF.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE question is often asked, “What is
the most important branch of culinary
knowledge? What the chief requisite in supplying
the table well and healthfully?”</p>

<p>The experienced housewife cannot hesitate
as to the reply.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, the ability to make <i>good</i>
bread. No one need rise hungry from a table
on which is plenty of light, sweet bread, white
or brown, and good butter. For the latter
item many of us are dependent upon market
and grocery. It is hardly just to hold the
cook responsible for imperfections in this regard
when she has bought the best articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
these supply. She is culpable if she fails to
see that her board furnishes three times a
day a bountiful allowance of what I hope
none of my friends in council will ever call
“<i>healthy</i> bread.” The eater may be made or
kept healthy by the consumption of nutritious,
wholesome, healthful or healthsome food; but
the most careful philologists do not speak of
edibles as subject to such diseases as may
afflict living creatures.</p>

<p>While it is always wise to use none except
the best flour in bread-making, it is true that
skilful management of an inferior brand will
often produce better loaves and biscuits than
careless treatment of fine family flour. I say
this that none may be discouraged. So far as
my observation and experience extend, nothing
can remedy the disadvantage of indifferent
yeast.</p>

<p>Let me earnestly advise, therefore, as the
foundation of successful baking, the manufacture
of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOME-MADE YEAST.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Four large mealy potatoes, peeled.</p>

<p>Two quarts of cold water.</p>

<p>One teacupful of loose, dry hops, <i>or</i>, half
a cake of the pressed hops put up by
the Shakers and sold by druggists.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of white sugar.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls of flour.</p>

<p>Half a cupful lively yeast, <i>or</i> a yeast-cake
dissolved in a little warm water.</p></div>

<p>Put water, potatoes, and the hops tied up
in a bit of coarse muslin, over the fire in a
clean pot or kettle. Boil until the potatoes
break apart when a fork is stuck into them.
Unless they are very old or very new, this
should be half an hour after the boiling begins.
Take out the potatoes, leaving water
and hops on the range where they will boil
slowly. Mash the potatoes smooth in a wooden
tray or large crockery bowl, with a wooden
spoon, and work in the sugar. When these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
are well-mixed wet the paste with three tablespoonfuls
of the boiling hop-tea, then stir in
a tablespoonful of flour. Do this four times,
beating and stirring to get rid of lumps.
When the flour is all in, add, a little at a
time, the rest of the hop-tea, squeezing the
bag hard to get every drop. Throw the boiled
hops away, and wash the cloth or bag well
before putting it aside for the next yeast-making.</p>

<p>Strain the thick, grayish liquid through a
colander into a bowl and let it get almost
but not quite cold before you stir in the
half cupful of made yeast that is to “raise”
it. Set aside out of the dust and wind, put
a sieve or throw a bit of mosquito netting
over it, and leave it to work. It is a good
plan to set the bowl in a large pan or dish
to catch what may run over the sides. When
the yeast ceases to sing or hiss, and the
bubbles no longer rise and break on the
surface, the fermentation is complete. Four
or five hours in July, seven in January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
usually bring this to pass. Pour the yeast
into glass fruit-jars with close covers, or stone-jars
fitted with corks, or common bottles,
tying the corks down with twine. Keep in a
<i>cool</i>, dark place, and do not open except to
draw off the quantity needed for a baking.
In the refrigerator it will keep good for a
month. Shake up the bottle before pouring
out what you want into a cup.</p>

<p>The creamy, foamy product thus obtained
is quite another thing from the dark, bitter
stuff pedled from one kitchen door to another
as brewer’s or baker’s yeast, unfit for use
unless strained, and then too frequently “unprofitable”
because “stale” and “flat.”</p>


<h3>THE FIRST LOAF.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart and a cupful of sifted flour (a
half pint cup)</p>

<p>One even teaspoonful dry salt.</p>

<p>Two full cups of blood-warm water.</p>

<p>Five tablespoonfuls of yeast (good ones).</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Sift the flour and salt together into a
wooden or stoneware bowl. Make a hole in
the middle and pour in the yeast, then a
cupful of the water. With clean hands begin
to work down the flour into the liquid, and
as it stiffens add the rest of the water. When
the dough is all wet dust your fingers with
dry flour, and rub off the paste into the bowl.
Scrape the sides of this, dust your fingers
again, and make all the dough into a lump
or ball. Dredge your pastry or bread-board
well with flour, put the dough upon it and
sift flour lightly over it. Ask your mother
or some experienced person whether or not it
is of the right consistency. There is so much
difference in various brands of flour that only
practice can teach one when the dough is
just right. <i>Do not get it too stiff.</i> Add flour
very cautiously even should it stick to your
fingers. Knead the bread for fifteen minutes—not
so fast as to tire yourself out of breath,
but steadily and hard, working it away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
you all the time, turning the ball over and
around so as to reach every part of the mass.
It should leave the board without stickiness
at the end of this time, be smooth, firm, and
elastic. Strike it hard with a tight fist, and
if the dent thus made fills up at once, you
have kneaded it sufficiently.</p>

<p>Sprinkle your bread-bowl with flour, put the
dough in the bottom, sift flour lightly over
the top, cover with a clean thick cloth and
set, in cold weather, in a moderately warm
place, in summer, out of the draught, but
away from the fire and sun. It should be
light in four hours in warm weather, in six
in winter. If you wish to have it for breakfast,
set at bedtime, and get up early to work
it over for the second rising.</p>

<p>This must not be done until the dough has
swollen immensely, and cracked over the top
like “crazed” china. Flour the board and
knead as before, now for ten minutes. Grease
two “brick” or round bread-pans well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sweet lard or butter, make out the dough in
two oblong or round loaves, and pat these
down in the pans to fit the corners. Prick
the tops with a sharp fork, cover with a
clean cloth, and let them stand for an hour
before putting them into the oven.</p>

<p>The oven must be steady, but not too hot.
You should be able to hold your bare arm in
it while you count twenty regularly. Should
the bread rise very fast at first, lay stout
paper over the top to prevent it from browning
before the heart is done. Do not allow the
stove or range to be filled with fresh coal
or wood while your bread is in the oven, or
it will be “slack-baked.” Should you need to
increase the heat, put in a stick or two of
wood to get up a brisk blaze. Do not open
the oven for ten or twelve minutes after the
bread goes in, and very seldom afterward. A
peep should suffice to see how it is getting
on. If the loaf rises higher at the back or at
one side than in front or on the other side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
turn the tin quickly, and do not jar it, or it
will “fall” into heavy streaks. If the oven is
right, your loaves should be done in <i>about</i>
thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Set the loaves up on the edge of one end,
leaning against the wall or an upright board,
that the air may dry the bottom, throw a
dry cloth over them and leave them to cool.
When quite cold wrap in a clean thick cloth
and keep in a tin box or stone crock.</p>

<p>In this, as in other first attempts, let me
warn you against being disheartened by failure,
partial or total. It would be far more strange
were you to accomplish perfection in one, or
in half a dozen lessons, than if your early
efforts should be only moderately successful.</p>

<p>See that your yeast is lively and not sour,
the flour good and dry, then follow directions
implicitly, and I think I can engage that the
result will not mortify you.</p>

<h2>2<br />

<small>BREAD SPONGE AND BREAKFAST BREADS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">BREAD raised with what is known to bakers
as a “sponge,” requires more time
and a trifle more work than the simpler form
for which I have just already given directions.
But it keeps fresh longer, is softer and more
nutritious, and a second-rate brand of flour
thus treated produces a better loaf than when
mixed up with yeast and water only. Sponge-making
is, therefore, an important if not an
essential accomplishment in a cook, be she
novice or veteran.</p>


<h3>Bread Sponge.</h3>


<div class="hangsection">

<p>Three potatoes of fair size, peeled and boiled
mealy.</p>

<p>Five tablespoonfuls of yeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>One tablespoonful of white sugar.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Three cups of lukewarm water in which
the potatoes were boiled—strained
through a coarse cloth.</p>

<p>One heaping cup of sifted flour.</p></div>

<p>Put the potatoes into a large bowl or tray
and mash them to powder with a potato beetle,
or a wooden spoon. While still hot, mix in
the sugar and butter, beating all to a lumpless
cream.</p>

<p>Add a <i>few</i> spoonfuls at a time, the potato-water
alternately with the flour by the
handful, beating the batter smooth as you go on
until all of the liquid and flour has gone in.
Beat hard one minute before pouring in the
yeast. In hot weather, it is well to stir into
the yeast a bit of soda no larger than a grain
of corn already wet up in a teaspoonful of
boiling water.</p>

<p>Now whip up the batter with a wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
spoon for another minute, and the sponge is
made.</p>

<p>Throw a cloth over the bowl and set by for
five or six hours to rise. If you intend to
bake in the forenoon, make the sponge at
bedtime. If in the afternoon, early in the
morning.</p>

<p>When the sponge is light sift a quart and
a cup of flour into a bowl or tray with two
teaspoonfuls of salt. Into a hollow, like a crater
in the middle of the flour, empty your sponge-bowl,
and work the flour down into it. Wash
out the bowl with a little lukewarm water
and add this to the dough. If it should prove
too soft, work in, cautiously, a little more
flour. If too stiff, warm water, a spoonful at
a time until you can handle the paste easily.
<i>The danger is in getting it too stiff.</i></p>

<p>Now, knead and set for risings first and
second, as you have already been instructed.
This sponge will be found especially useful in
making</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h3>Graham Bread.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of Graham flour, one cup of
white flour.</p>

<p>One half cup of Indian meal.</p>

<p>One half cup of molasses.</p>

<p>Two teaspoonfuls of salt.</p>

<p>Soda, the size of a pea.</p>

<p>Half the quantity of sponge given in preceding
receipt.</p>

<p>Warm water for rinsing bowl—about half
a cup.</p></div>

<p>Put the brown or Graham flour <i>unsifted</i> into
the bread-bowl. Sift into it white flour, meal
and salt, and stir up well while dry. Into the
“crater” dug out in the middle, pour the
sponge, warm water, the molasses, and soda
dissolved in hot water. Knead as you would
white bread, and set aside for the rising. It
will not swell so fast as the white, so give
yourself more time for making it.</p>

<p>When light, knead well and long; make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into two loaves, then put into well-greased
pans and leave for an hour, or until it becomes
more than twice the original size of the
dough.</p>

<p>Take care that it does not burn in baking.
The molasses renders it liable to scorching.
The oven must be steady, but not so hot as
for white bread, nor will the Graham bread be
done quite so soon as that made of bolted flour.
Turn the pans once while baking, moving them
as gently as possible. If rudely shaken or
jarred, there will be heavy streaks in the
loaves.</p>

<p>Graham bread is wholesome and sweet, and
ought to be eaten frequently in every family,
particularly by young people whose bones and
teeth are in forming.</p>

<p>The phosphates which the process of “bolting”
removes to a large extent from white flour,
go directly to the manufacture of bone, and
these also tend to nourish and strengthen the
brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3>Tea-Rolls.</h3>

<p>After mixing your bread in the morning
either with sponge or with yeast, divide the
kneaded dough into two portions. Mould one
into a round ball, and set aside for a loaf as
already directed. Make a hole in the middle
of the other batch and pour into it a tablespoonful
of butter, just melted, but not hot.
Close the dough over it, dust your hands and
kneading-board with flour and work in the
shortening until the dough is elastic and
ceases to be sticky. Put it into a floured bowl,
cover with a cloth and set away out of draught
and undue heat, for three hours. Knead it
again, then, and wait upon its rising for another
three hours. The dough should be as soft
as can be handled.</p>

<p>When it is light for the second time flour
your board, rubbing in the flour and blowing
lightly away what does not adhere to the surface.
Toss the lump dough upon it and knead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thoroughly for five minutes. Flour a rolling-pin
and roll the dough into a sheet not more
than half an inch thick. Cut this into round
cakes with a biscuit-cutter or a sharp-edged
tumbler and fold, not quite in the middle, in
the form of turnovers, pinching the corners
of the fold pretty hard to hinder the flap of
dough from flying up as the rising proceeds.
Rub the bottom and sides of a baking-pan
with sweet lard or butter. Do this with a
bit of clean soft rag or tissue-paper, visiting
every corner of the pan, but not leaving thick
layers and streaks of grease after it. Arrange
the rolls in regular rows in the pan about a
quarter of an inch apart.</p>

<p>Cover with a cloth and set nearer the fire
than you dared trust the dough, and let them
rise for an hour. Peep under the cloth two
or three times to see whether they rise evenly,
and turn the pan around once that all may
be equally exposed to the heat.</p>

<p>When the time is up and the rolls are puffy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and promising, set them in a pretty quick
oven and bake half an hour, turning the pan
once in this time, and covering with clean—never
printed—paper, should they brown too
fast. Break the rolls apart from one another
and eat warm. They are also good cold, and
if the directions be followed implicitly, very
good always.</p>


<h3>Graham Rolls</h3>

<p>Are made by treating the dough mixed for
Graham bread as above and following the foregoing
receipt in every section, but allowing
more time for rising and baking. They are
even better when cold than hot.</p>


<h3>Breakfast Biscuit.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of fresh milk slightly warmed.</p>

<p>One quart and a cup of flour sifted.</p>

<p>Five tablespoonfuls of yeast.</p>

<p>One even tablespoonful of white sugar.</p>

<p>One even teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Bit of soda as large as a pea, dissolved
in hot water.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter, just melted,
not hot.</p>

<p>Yolk of one egg beaten light.</p></div>

<p>Sift the flour, salt and sugar into a bowl,
hollow the heap in the centre and pour in
the milk, working down the flour into the
liquid with a spoon or your hands until it is
thoroughly melted. Into a second hollow pour
the yeast and knead thoroughly for fifteen minutes.
Wrap bowl and biscuit in a thick cloth
and set to rise where it will neither become
chilled nor sour over night. (Study the temperature
in different parts of the kitchen and
kitchen closets to the end of finding the best
places for raising dough and sponge.)</p>

<p>Do all this at bedtime. Early in the morning
turn out the dough upon a floured board,
work it for a minute into manageable shape;
drill several finger-holes in it and fill them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with the melted butter, the dissolved soda and the
beaten yolk of egg. Pinch the dough hard to stop
the mouths of these cavities, and knead for ten
minutes, carefully at first, lest the liquids should
be wasted, and more boldly when they are
absorbed by the paste. Roll out into a sheet
half an inch thick with a floured rolling-pin;
cut into round cakes, set these closely together
in a well-greased pan; prick each with
a fork and let them rise near the fire for half
an hour, covered with a light cloth.</p>

<p>Bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes in
a quick oven, turning the pan around once,
quickly and lightly. Break apart from one another
and pile on a plate, throwing a clean
doily or a small napkin over them. Break
open at table. Hot rolls and muffins should
never be cut.</p>

<p>One word with regard to getting up early
in order to give dough a chance for the second
rising. It is <i>not</i> a wholesome practice for any
woman—least of all a young girl to be out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of bed two hours before she eats her breakfast.
Studying upon an empty stomach provokes
dyspepsia and injures the eyes. Active
exercise in like circumstances tempts debility
and disease. Yet our bread and rolls must be
looked after at the proper time. Have yourself
called on biscuit mornings an hour earlier
than usual. Rise, wash face and hands, rinse
the mouth out and brush back the hair. Put
on stockings and slippers, such underclothing
as may be needed to prevent cold, a wrapper
and the kitchen apron. Cover your hair entirely
with a handkerchief or sweeping cap.
Before beginning operations down-stairs eat a
half-slice of dry bread or a biscuit. You will
not relish it, but take it all the same to appease
the empty, discontented stomach. Having
made out your rolls and tucked them up
snugly for the final rise, return to your chamber
for a comfortable bath and toilet. When
habited for the day in all except the outer
gown, collar, etc., slip on the wrapper again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and run down to put the biscuits in the oven.
Unless it is <i>too</i> hot, they will get no harm
while you finish dressing in ten minutes, just
in season to turn the pan.</p>

<p>From the beginning of your apprenticeship
in housewifery, learn how to “dovetail” your
duties neatly into one another. A wise accommodation
of parts and angles, and compactness
in the adjustment of “must-be-dones”
are better than mere personal strength in the
accomplishment of such tasks as fall to women
to perform. Master these, and do not let
them master you. Weave the little duties in
and under and among what seem to be the
greater. While your bread is taking a three
hours’ rise, you are free in body and mind
for other things. The grand secret of keeping
house well and without worry, lies in the art
of packing and fitting different kinds of work
and in picking up the minutes. Other things
besides rising dough get on quite as well without
your standing by to watch them.</p>

<h2>3<br />

<small>BREAKFAST BREADS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">UNDER this head may be classed muffins,
griddle-cakes, crumpets, corn bread, Sally
Lunn, quick biscuits, and a dozen other varieties
of warm bread suitable for breakfast and
tea. They furnish a very pleasant variety in
the daily bill of fare, and are extremely popular.</p>

<p>Nor are they unwholesome if properly made
and cooked, and eaten by well people. To
weak and impaired digestive organs all kinds
of warm bread are hurtful.</p>


<h3>English Muffins.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of sifted flour.</p>

<p>Two cups of lukewarm water.</p>

<p>Half a cup of yeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter melted, but
not hot. One teaspoonful of salt sifted
with the flour.</p></div>

<p>Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make
a hole in the middle and pour in yeast and
warm water. Stir down the flour gradually
into the liquid, and when all is in, beat hard
with a wooden spoon. Should the mixture be
too stiff for this, add a little more water.
It should be about half as thick as bread-dough.
Beat for five minutes and set aside to rise,
with a cloth thrown over the bowl, in a
moderately warm corner.</p>

<p>Early in the morning stir the melted butter
into the dough, beat hard for two minutes,
and leave for half an hour in the covered
bowl in a warm place—such as on a stool
near the fire—turning it several times.</p>

<p>Grease muffin-rings well with sweet lard,
arrange them upon a greased griddle set over
the fire and already warmed (not really hot),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fill about half-way to the top with batter, and
bake quickly. When the dough fills the rings
and begins to look firm on the top, slip a
knife under one and peep at the under side.
If it is delicately browned, turn the rings
over with a spatula or cake-turner. This must
be done quickly and dexterously, so as not to
spill the batter.</p>

<p>When quite done, wrap a thick cloth about
your fingers, take up the muffin-rings one by
one; pass a sharp knife around the inside of
each, to loosen the muffin, and shake it out
upon a hot plate. Pile them up neatly and
cover with a clean napkin. These muffins
must be broken, not cut open, and buttered
while hot.</p>

<p>The English split, toast and butter cold
muffins.</p>


<h3>Crumpets.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of lukewarm milk.</p>

<p>Two thirds of a cup of lukewarm water.</p>

<p>One quart of sifted flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>One tablespoonful of white sugar.</p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</p>

<p>Half a cupful of yeast.</p>

<p>Soda the size of a pea, dissolved in a
teaspoonful of boiling water.</p></div>

<p>Mix milk, yeast, water, sugar and salted
flour as directed in former receipt. Beat hard,
and set to rise over night. In the morning
work in the butter and soda, beat up for one
whole minute until the mixture is light throughout,
and half-fill greased patty-pans with it.
Set these in a baking-pan, cover with a cloth,
and let them stand in a warm place fifteen
minutes before putting them into a steady
oven. They should be done in from twelve to
fifteen minutes if the oven is right. If they
brown too fast, cover them with paper.</p>


<h3>Quick Muffins.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of sifted flour.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Three cups lukewarm milk.</p>

<p>Two eggs.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.</p></div>

<p>Sift flour, baking-powder and salt <i>twice</i>
through the sieve, to make sure these are
well mixed together. Beat the eggs very light.
(By all means have a Dover Egg-Beater for
this purpose. It whips eggs to a lovely froth
with less labor and in less time than any
other yet invented.)</p>

<p>Stir melted butter, eggs and milk together
in a large bowl, and to this add the flour, a
cupful at a time, stirring very quickly and
lightly down toward the middle of the bowl.
Beat hard <i>up</i> one minute at the last, to
break flour-lumps; half-fill greased patty-pans
with the batter, and then bake in a quick
oven.</p>

<p>Turn out and eat while puffy and hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>Sally Lunn. (The “Genuine Article.”)</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of sifted flour.</p>

<p>One cup of warm milk.</p>

<p>One of warm water.</p>

<p>Four large tablespoonfuls of yeast.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</p>

<p>Four eggs.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of salt sifted with the
flour.</p>

<p>Soda the size of a pea, dissolved in a
teaspoonful of boiling water.</p></div>

<p>Beat the eggs steadily four minutes. Have
ready in a bowl the warmed milk, water,
melted butter and soda. Into this stir the
salted flour, cupful by cupful, until all is in.
Beat smooth from lumps and add the yeast.
The eggs should now be whipped three minutes
with the “Dover,” in a cool bowl. They will
not froth in a hot or warm one. When light,
beat well into the batter, and then beat <i>up</i>
hard for a full minute. A wooden spoon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
best for this purpose. Butter a tin cake-mould
well in every part, and put in the batter. If
there is more than enough to half-fill the
mould have two prepared, that the contents
may not overflow in rising.</p>

<p>Set in a moderately warm place for six
hours at least, and then bake in the mould
for three quarters of an hour if there is but
one loaf, half an hour if there are two.</p>

<p>The oven must be steady and not very hot
at first. Turn the mould twice in this time
keeping the oven door open as short a time
as possible. When you think the loaf is done,
thrust a clean straw down into the thickest
part.</p>

<p>If it comes up as clean as when it went
in, take out the bread. Slip a knife around
the edge to loosen it, and turn out upside down
on a warm plate.</p>

<p>Cut in triangular slices at table, holding the
knife upright to avoid crushing and making
it heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>Quick Biscuits.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of sifted flour.</p>

<p>Two heaping tablespoonfuls of sweet, firm
lard.</p>

<p>Two cups of new milk (warm from the
cow if you can get it.)</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of baking powder.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of salt.</p></div>

<p>Sift salt, flour, and baking-powder twice
into a bowl or tray. With a clean sharp
chopping-knife work the lard into this, turning
and chopping until no lumps are left. Into a
hollow in the middle pour the milk, working
the flour downward until you have a soft, wet
mass, using the chopper for this purpose.
Flour your pastry-board and your hands, make
the dough into a ball, handling it as little as
possible, and lay on the board. Roll out with
a floured rolling-pin into a sheet half an inch
in thickness, and with <i>very few strokes</i>. Cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
into round cakes, sift flour lightly over the
bottom of a baking-pan, and set your biscuits—just
<i>not</i> touching one another—in even
rows within it.</p>

<p>Bake about twelve minutes in a quick oven.
The dough should have a rough appearance
before it is baked, like what is known as
“pebbled morocco.” Too much handling will
make it sleek without and tough within.</p>

<p>You can make excellent quick biscuits by
the above receipt, by substituting Hecker’s Prepared
Flour for the barreled family flour, and
omitting the baking-powder. You will, however,
probably be obliged to add a little more milk,
as prepared flour “thickens up” rather more
than other brands.</p>

<h2>4<br />

<small>OTHER BREAKFAST BREADS.</small></h2>


<h3>Griddle Cakes.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN making these, let quickness be the first,
second and third rules. Beat briskly and
thoroughly; mix just as you are ready to
send the cakes to the table (except when
yeast is used), bake, turn, and serve promptly.
Have all your materials on the table, measured
and ready to your hand. The griddle must
be perfectly clean and wiped off with a dry
cloth just before you lay it on the stove.
Heat it gradually at one side of the stove
or range, and when it is warm grease with
a bit of fat salt pork stuck firmly on a fork.
The fat should be hissing hot, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
scorching, when the batter is poured on.
Before putting the cakes on to fry, slip the
griddle to the hottest part of the stove.
Drop the batter in great, even spoonfuls, and
be careful not to spill or spatter it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. H. Phillips and Co.</span>, of Troy, N. Y.,
manufacture a griddle with three shallow cups
sunken in an iron plate which moves on a
hinge. When the cakes are done on the
lower side the turn of a handle reverses the
plate upon a heated surface. This makes the
cakes of equal size and thickness and saves
the trouble of watching, spatula in hand, to
turn each one. It greatly simplifies the
process of baking cakes, and, lessens the
heating labor of attending to them.</p>

<p>Be sure that each cake is done before you
turn it. A twice-turned “griddle” is spoiled.</p>


<h3>Sour-milk Cakes.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of “loppered,” or of buttermilk.</p>

<p>Three cups of sifted flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>One cup of Indian meal.</p>

<p>One “rounded” teaspoonful of soda free
from lumps.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of molasses.</p></div>

<p>Sift flour, salt and meal into a bowl. In
another mix the milk, molasses and soda.
Stir these last to a foam, and pour into the
hollow in the middle of the flour. Work
down the flour into the liquid with a wooden
spoon until you have a batter, and beat <i>hard</i>
with upward strokes, two minutes. Bake at
once. These are cheap, easy and good cakes.</p>


<h3>Hominy Cakes.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of fine hominy boiled and cold.
(Take the tough skin from the top
before mixing in the batter.)</p>

<p>One heaping cup of sifted flour.</p>

<p>One quart of milk.</p>

<p>Three eggs beaten very light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>One tablespoonful of molasses.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of salt.</p></div>

<p>Rub the hominy with the back of a wooden
spoon until all the lumps are broken up. Wet
it little by little with the milk and molasses,
working it smooth as you go on. Sift flour
and salt together, and put in next. Beat for
a whole minute before adding the whipped
eggs, and another minute very hard, before
baking. Stir up well from the bottom before
putting each fresh batch of cakes on the
griddle.</p>

<p>These cakes if properly made, are tender,
wholesome and delightful.</p>


<h3>Graham Cakes.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of Graham flour.</p>

<p>One of sifted white.</p>

<p>One heaping tablespoonful of Indian meal.</p>

<p>Three cups of buttermilk, or loppered milk.</p>

<p>One rounded teaspoonful of soda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of molasses.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of salt sifted with the
flour.</p>

<p>Two eggs whipped very light.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful melted butter.</p></div>

<p>Put Graham and salted white flour into a
bowl with the Indian meal. Stir up in another
milk, molasses, soda and melted butter, and
while foaming pour into the hollowed flour.
Work to a good batter and beat in the eggs
already whipped to a froth.</p>

<p>Beat one minute and bake at once.</p>

<p>This is a good standard breakfast hot bread.</p>

<h2>5<br />

<small>EGGS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">MANY people do not know a well-boiled
egg by sight or taste, yet a <i>fresh</i> egg,
boiled to a nicety, is one of the simplest, most
nutritious of breakfast dishes.</p>


<h3>Boiled Eggs.</h3>

<p>Select the cleanest eggs, wash them well, and
lay them in lukewarm water for five minutes.
Have ready on the fire a saucepan of water
on a fast boil, and in quantity sufficient to
cover the eggs entirely. Into this put one
egg at a time with a spoon, depositing each
gently on the bottom, and quickly.</p>

<p><i>Four minutes</i> boils an egg thoroughly, if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
likes the white set and the yolk heated to the
centre. <i>Five minutes</i> makes the white firm and
sets the yolk. <i>Ten minutes</i> boils both hard.</p>

<p>Take up the eggs with a split spoon or
wire whisk. If you have no regular egg dish,
lay a heated napkin in a deep dish or bowl
(also warmed), put in the eggs as in a nest,
cover up with the corners of the napkin, and
send directly to the table. They harden in the
shells if left long without being broken.</p>

<p>The best way to manage a boiled egg at
the table is the English way of setting it
upright in the small end of the egg-cup,
making a hole in the top large enough to
admit the egg-spoon, and eating it from the
shell, seasoning as you go on. Heat and taste
are undoubtedly better preserved by this method
than by any other. Those who cannot afford
gold-washed spoons, can procure pretty ivory
ones at a trifling cost, or small teaspoons will
serve the purpose.</p>

<p>Spoons smeared with eggs should be laid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
soak in <i>cold</i> water directly you have finished
using them.</p>


<h3>Custard Eggs.</h3>

<p>Put the washed eggs in a saucepan of cold
water and let them just come to a boil, then
take them up.</p>

<p>Or, lay them in a hot tin pail, cover them
with boiling water, put the top on the pail
and leave them on the kitchen table for five
minutes. Drain off the water, pour on more
<i>boiling</i> hot and replace the top. Wrap a
hot towel about the pail, and leave it four
minutes before dishing the eggs. They will
be like a soft custard throughout, and more
digestible than if cooked in any other way.</p>


<h3>Poached, or Dropped Eggs.</h3>

<p>Into a clean frying-pan, pour plenty of boiling
water, and a teaspoonful of salt. Let it
boil steadily, not violently. Wipe a cup dry,
break an egg into it, and pour, very cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and quickly, on the surface of the
water. Avoid spreading or breaking it. It will
sink to the bottom for an instant, but if the
water is boiling hot, will rise soon and be
cooked in about three and a half minutes.
Do not put more than three into the pan at
one time, or they will run into one another.</p>

<p>Take them up with a perforated skimmer
and lay on a hot, flat dish in which a teaspoonful
of butter has been melted. If the
whites have ragged edges, trim neatly with a
sharp knife. When all are done, pepper and
salt lightly, put a bit of butter on each egg
and send up <i>very hot</i>.</p>


<h3>Eggs on Toast.</h3>

<p>Cut out with a sharp-edged tumbler or a
cake cutter as many round slices of stale
bread as there are eggs to be cooked. Toast
these nicely, butter thinly; cover the bottom
of a heated dish with them, and pour on each
a tablespoonful of boiling water. Set in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
plate-warmer or an open oven while you poach
eggs as directed in the last receipt.</p>

<p>Lay each when done on a round of toast,
pepper, salt and butter, and serve.</p>


<h3>Eggs on Savory Toast.</h3>

<p>Toast rounds of stale bread as directed in
preceding receipt, but instead of moistening
them with hot water, pour upon them, as they
lie in the dish, two tablespoonfuls of boiling
gravy to each slice. A half-cupful of gravy
left over from yesterday’s roast or stew skimmed
free of fat, heated, thinned with a very little
boiling water, well-seasoned, then strained and
boiled up quickly, makes this a tempting dish.</p>

<p>Poach as many eggs as you have rounds
of toast, and lay on these, with pepper, salt
and bits of butter.</p>


<h3>Scrambled or Stirred Eggs.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Nine eggs.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>A little pepper.</p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley very
fine.</p></div>

<p>Break the eggs altogether in a bowl. Put
the butter in a clean frying-pan and set it on
the range. As it melts, add pepper, salt and
parsley. When it hisses, pour in the eggs,
and begin at once to stir them, scraping the
bottom of the pan from the sides toward the
centre, until you have a soft, moist mass just
firm enough not to run over the bottom of
the heated dish on which you turn it out.
Make it into a neat mound. Some people
prefer it without the parsley.</p>

<p>In serving <i>everything</i>, be careful that the
rims of the dishes are perfectly clean. The
effect of the most delicious viand is spoiled
by drops or smears of food on the vessel
containing it.</p>

<p>If you heap your scrambled eggs on a platter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and lay parsley-sprigs around, making a
green fringe or border for the yellow hillock,
you have an elegant dish. Study to make plain
things pretty when you can.</p>


<h3>Bacon and Eggs.</h3>

<p>Fry as many slices of ham, or what is
known as breakfast-bacon, as there are eggs
to be cooked. Have the clean frying-pan warm,
but not hot, when the meat goes in. Turn
the slices as they brown. When done, take
the pan over to the sink or table, remove the
meat to a hot dish and set where it will
keep warm.</p>

<p>Strain the grease left in the pan through a
bit of tarlatan or coarse muslin into a cup.
Wipe the frying-pan clean, pour in the strained
fat and return to the fire. If there is not
enough to cover the bottom a quarter of an
inch deep, add a tablespoonful of butter.
Break the eggs one at a time in a cup, and
when the fat hisses put them in carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Few people like “turned” fried eggs. Slip
a cake-turner or spatula under each as it cooks
to keep it from sticking. They should be
done in about three minutes. Do not put in
more at once than can swim in the fat without
interfering with one another.</p>

<p>Take up as fast as they cook, trim off ragged
and rusty edges and lay on a hot platter.
Drain each to get rid of the fat, as you take
it out of the pan.</p>

<p>When all are dished, lay the ham or bacon
neatly about the eggs like a garnish. Pepper
all lightly. Ham for this purpose should be
cut in small narrow slices.</p>

<p>Drop sprays of parsley on the rim of the
dish.</p>


<h3>Baked Eggs.</h3>

<p>Put a tablespoonful of butter in a pie-plate,
and set in the oven until it melts and begins
to smoke. Take it to the table and break
six eggs one by one into a cup, pouring each
in turn into the melted butter carefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Sprinkle with pepper and salt, put a tiny bit
of butter on each and set in the oven to
bake until the eggs are “set”—that is, when the
whites are firm and the yolks skimmed over,
but not hard. Four minutes in a quick oven
should do this. Send to table at once.</p>

<p>If you have a few spoonfuls of nice chicken
gravy, you can strain and use it instead of
butter.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Eggs.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Six eggs.</p>

<p>Half a cupful of nice gravy skimmed and
strained. Chicken, turkey, game and
veal gravy are especially good for this
purpose. Clear soup may also be used.</p>

<p>Half a cupful of pounded cracker or fine
dry bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p></div>

<p>Pour the gravy into a pie-plate and let it
get warm before putting in the eggs as in
last receipt. Pepper, salt and strew cracker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
crumbs evenly over them. Bake five minutes.
Serve in the pie-plate.</p>


<h3>Dropped Eggs with White Sauce.</h3>

<p>Drop or poach the eggs; put them on a
hot, flat dish and pour over them this sauce
boiling hot.</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>In a saucepan put half a cupful of boiling
water.</p>

<p>Two or three large spoonfuls of nice strained
gravy.</p>

<p>A little pepper.</p>

<p>A quarter teaspoonful of salt.</p></div>

<p>When this boils stir in a heaping teaspoonful
of flour wet up smoothly with a little
cold water to keep it from lumping. Stir and
boil one minute and add a tablespoonful
of butter. Stir steadily two minutes longer,
add, if you like, a little minced parsley, and
pour the sauce which should be like thick
cream, over the dished eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3>Omelette.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Six eggs.</p>

<p>Four teaspoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>A little pepper.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of butter.</p></div>

<p>Whip whites and yolks together for four
minutes in a bowl with the “Dover” egg
beater. They should be thick and smooth
before you beat in cream, salt and pepper.
Melt the butter in a clean frying-pan, set on
one side of the stove where it will keep warm
but not scorch. Pour the beaten mixture into
it and remove to a place where the fire is
hotter. As it “sets,” slip a broad knife carefully
around the edges and under it, that the
butter may find its way freely to all parts of
the pan.</p>

<p>When the middle is just set, pass a cake-turner
<i>carefully</i> under one half of the omelette
and fold it over the other. Lay a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
platter upside down above the doubled mass
and holding frying-pan and dish firmly, turn
the latter quickly over, reversing the positions
of the two, and depositing the omelette in
the dish.</p>

<p>Do not be mortified should you break your
trial omelette. Join the bits neatly; lay sprays
of parsley over the cracks and try another
soon. Be sure it is loosened from the pan
before you try to turn it out; hold pan and dish
fast in place; do not be nervous or flurried,
and you will soon catch the knack of dishing
the omelette dexterously and handsomely.</p>

<p>I have given you ten receipts for cooking
eggs. It would be easy to furnish as many
more without exhausting the list of ways of
preparing this invaluable article of food for
our tables. I have selected the methods that
are at once easy and excellent, and adapted
to the ability of a class of beginners.</p>

<h2>6<br />

<small>BROILED MEATS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT has been said that the frying-pan has
ruined more American digestions than all
the other hurtful agencies combined. It is
certainly true that while the process of frying
<i>properly</i> performed upon certain substances
does not of necessity, make them unwholesome—the
useful utensil does play altogether
too important a part in our National
cookery. Broiled meats are more wholesome,
more palatable, and far more elegant. Certain
things should never be fried. That beefsteak
should <i>never</i> make the acquaintance of the
frying-pan is a rule without an exception.</p>

<p>The best gridirons for private families are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
light, double “broilers,” made of tinned wire
and linked together at the back with loops
of the same material. They are easily handled,
turned and cleansed, and when not in
use may be hung on the wall out of the way.
It is well to have two sizes, one for large
steaks, the smaller for birds, oysters, and when
there is occasion to broil a single chop or
chicken-leg for an invalid.</p>


<h3>Beefsteak.</h3>

<p>Never wash a steak unless it has fallen in
the dirt or met with other accident. In this
case cleanse quickly in cold water and wipe
perfectly dry before cooking.</p>

<p>Have a clear hot fire and do not uncover
that part of the stove above it until you have
adjusted the steak on the broiler. If you use
the ordinary iron gridiron, lay the meat on it
the instant it goes over the fire, but have it
already warm and rub the bars with a bit of
fresh suet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>When the meat has lain over the coals two
minutes and begins to “sizzle,” turn it and
let the other side cook as long. Watch it
continually and turn whenever it begins to
drip. Do this quickly to keep in the juices.
If these should fall in the fire in spite of
your care, lift it for an instant and hold over
a plate or dish until the smoke is gone.
Broiled meats flavored with creosote are not
uncommon, but always detestable. The knack
of broiling a steak well is to turn it so often
and dexterously that it will neither be smoked
nor scorched.</p>

<p>Ten minutes should cook it rare, if the fire
is right and the steak not very thick. Cut
with a keen blade into the thickest part when
the time is up. If the heart is of a rich red-brown—not
the livid purple of uncooked flesh,
carry broiler and meat to a table where stands
a hot dish. Lay the steak on this. In a
saucer have a liberal tablespoonful of butter
cut into bits, and with these rub both sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the smoking steak, leaving unmelted pieces
on the top. Sprinkle it also on both sides
with pepper and salt—about half a teaspoonful
of salt and a third as much pepper for a
large steak. All this must be done <i>quickly</i>.
Before you begin to cook the steak, prepare
the butter and measure the salt and pepper.
Cover the dish closely. If you have not a
block-tin dish-cover, lay over the steak another
dish, made very hot in the oven, and set
both with the meat between them in the plate-warmer,
or in an open oven, or somewhere
where it will keep hot for three minutes.</p>

<p>Serve—i. e. put on the table—as hot as
possible and on warm plates. Unless you
have a hot water dish, do not send the steak
into the dining-room until all have taken their
places.</p>

<p>Sometimes steak is tough. You shake your
head over it as it comes from the butcher’s
basket. I know of an enterprising meat merchant
who objected to a wealthy customer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
because he would have choice cuts. He was
willing to pay double for them, but as the
worthy seller observed: “We <i>must</i> sell second-best
cuts, and he’d ought to take his turn.”</p>

<p>Like sin, tough steak ought not to be, but it
<i>is!</i> If your turn to take it has come, lay it
on a clean board, some hours before cooking
it, and hack it on both sides, criss-cross, with
a tolerably sharp knife, taking care not to
cut too deeply. Rub both sides very well with
the strained juice of a lemon, and set the meat
in a cold place until you are ready to cook
it. Do this over night, if you want it for
breakfast. Very tough, fibrous meat is sometimes
made eatable by this process.</p>


<h3>Mutton or Lamb Chops.</h3>

<p>Cut off most of the fat and all the skin.
A clean bone an inch in length will project
from the smaller end when you have pared
away the tallow and skin which would have
cooked into rankness and leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Put as many chops on the broiler as it will
conveniently hold, and broil as you would
beefsteak. Cut into the largest to see if it is
done. If it is, lay the chops on a heated
dish set over a pot of boiling water; butter,
pepper and salt them, and cover them up
while you cook the rest.</p>

<p>Serve as soon as the last is cooked, as
they lose flavor with standing.</p>

<p>Lay sprigs of parsley around the edges
of the dish and scatter a few over the chops
which must be arranged in neat rows, a small
end next to a large.</p>


<h3>Broiled Ham.</h3>

<p>Cut even slices from a cold boiled Ferris &amp;
Co.’s “Trade Mark” ham. Divide these into
oblong pieces about an inch and a half in width,
and broil quickly over clear coals until a delicate
brown touches the slices here and there.
Lay in order on a hot dish. Broiled ham is
appetizing, and should be accompanied by dry
toast, lightly buttered.</p>

<h2>7<br />

<small>FRIED MEATS.</small></h2>


<h3>Larded Liver.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE butcher will slice the liver, or show
you how to do it. When it is cut up,
lay it in cold water in which has been stirred
a teaspoonful of salt. This will draw out the
blood.</p>

<p>Cut fat, raw salt pork into strips a finger
long and a quarter of an inch thick and
wide.</p>

<p>In half an hour’s time take the liver from
the water, spread it out on a clean dry cloth,
lay another cloth over the slices and pat
gently to dry them thoroughly. Make holes
an inch apart in the liver with a pen-knife or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sharp skewer, and stick in the pork strips.
They should protrude an equal distance on
both sides.</p>

<p>As fast as they are ready, lay them in a
clean, warm (<i>not</i> hot) frying-pan. When all
are in, set it over the fire, and let it fry
rather slowly in the fat that will run out from
the pork “lardoons.” In five minutes turn the
slices, and again ten minutes later. Let the
liver heat quite slowly for the first ten minutes.
If cooked fast it is hard and indigestible.
Allow about twenty-five minutes for frying it.</p>

<p>Take it up with a fork, draining off every
drop of grease against the side of the pan as
you remove each piece, and dish on a hot
platter.</p>

<p>Put a half a teaspoonful of tomato sauce on
each slice. Serve without gravy and very hot.</p>


<h3>Veal Cutlets (Breaded).</h3>

<p>Whip two eggs light and pour them into a
pie-plate. Turn the cutlets, one by one, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in this until every part is coated. In another
dish spread evenly a cupful of rolled or pounded
cracker, very fine and dry. Turn the “egged”
cutlets over in this to encrust them well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile four large spoonfuls of sweet lard
or nice beef-dripping must be melting in a
clean frying-pan at one side of the range.
When the cutlets are all breaded, move the
pan directly over the fire. As the fat begins
a lively hiss, put in as many cutlets as can
lie in it without crowding. In five minutes
turn them with care, not to loosen the crumb-coating.
After another five minutes of rapid
frying, pull the pan to a spot where the cooking
will go on slowly, but regularly. In ten
minutes turn the cutlets a second time. In
another ten minutes they should be done.</p>

<p>Understand! The first fast cooking sears
the surface of the meat and forms the breading
into a firm crust that keeps in the juices.
The slower work that follows cooks the veal
thoroughly without hardening the fibres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Lift the cutlets carefully from the pan,
draining all the grease from each, and keep
hot in a covered dish set over a pot of
boiling water until all are done.</p>

<p>Always put tomato catsup or tomato sauce,
in some form, on the table with veal cutlets.</p>


<h3>Sausage Cakes.</h3>

<p>Break off bits of sausage meat of equal
size, roll them in the palms of clean hands
into balls and pat them into flat cakes.
Arrange them in a frying-pan and cook (not
too fast) in their own fat, turning them twice
until they are nicely and evenly browned.
The time allowed for frying them depends on
the size of the cakes. If they are not large,
fifteen minutes should be enough.</p>

<p>Serve on a hot dish, without gravy.</p>


<h3>Smothered Sausages.</h3>

<p>Prick “link” sausages—that is, those done
up in skins, in fifteen or twenty places, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a large needle; put them in a clean frying-pan
in which is a half a teacup full of hot
water. Roll the sausages over in this several
times and cover <i>closely</i>. If you have not the
lid of a pot or of a tin-pail that fits the
frying-pan, use a pie-dish turned upside down.
Set the pan where the water will bubble
slowly, for ten minutes. Lift the cover then,
and roll the sausages over again two or three
times, to wet them thoroughly, leaving them
with the sides up that were down. Cover
again and cook ten minutes longer. Turn
them twice more, at intervals of five minutes,
cover, and let them steam four minutes before
taking them up. They will be plump, whole,
tender and well-done, and the bottom of the
pan be almost dry. Lay in neat rows on a
hot dish.</p>


<h3>Fish Balls.</h3>

<p>Soak a pound of cod-fish all night in cold
water. Change it in the morning, and cover
with lukewarm water for three hours more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Wash it, scraping off the salt and fat; put it
into a sauce-pan, cover it well with water just
blood-warm, and let it simmer—that is, not
<i>quite</i> boil, two hours. Take it up, pick out the
bones and remove the skin, and set the fish
aside to cool.</p>

<p>When perfectly cold chop it fine in a wooden
tray. Have ready, for a cupful of minced fish,
nearly two cupfuls of potato boiled and mashed
very smooth.</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>A tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of milk worked into
the fish while hot.</p>

<p>Add also, when the potato has been
rubbed until free from lumps, the
beaten yolk of an egg. Work this in
well with a wooden or silver spoon.</p>

<p>Now stir in the chopped fish, a little at a
time, mixing all together until you have
a soft mass which you can handle
easily.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Drop a tablespoonful of the mixture on a
floured pastry board, or a floured dish. Flour
your hands, roll the fish and potato into
a ball, and pat it into a cake, or make it as
round as a marble. Lay these as you form
them on a dish dusted with flour, and when
all are made out, set in a cool place until
morning.</p>

<p>Half an hour before breakfast, have five or
six great spoonfuls of sweet lard hissing hot in
a frying-pan or doughnut-kettle. Put in the
balls a few at a time; turn as they color;
take them out when they are of a tanny
brown, lay them in a hot colander set in a
plate, and keep warm in the open oven until
all are fried.</p>


<h3>A Breakfast Stew (very nice).</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two pounds of lean beef. (The “second
best cuts” may be used here.)</p>

<p>A quarter of a medium-sized onion.</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of browned flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Half a teaspoonful each of minced parsley,
summer savory, and sweet marjoram.</p>

<p>As much allspice as will lie on a silver
dime.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of Halford sauce.</p>

<p>One saltspoonful of made mustard.</p>

<p>One saltspoonful of pepper.</p>

<p>Strained juice of half a lemon.</p></div>

<p>Cut the meat into pieces an inch square.
Put it with the chopped onion into a saucepan
with a pint of lukewarm water; cover
closely and cook slowly, <i>at least</i> two hours
and a half. The meat should not be allowed
to boil hard at any time, and when done, be
so tender that it is ready to fall to pieces.</p>

<p>Pour the stew into a bowl, add the salt and
pepper, cover it and set in a cool place until
next morning.</p>

<p>Then put it back into the sauce-pan, set it
over a quick fire, and when it begins to boil,
stir in the spice and herbs. (The latter may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be bought dried and powdered at the druggist’s
if you cannot get them fresh.)</p>

<p>Boil up sharply five minutes.</p>

<p>The flour should be browned the day before,
by spreading it on a tin plate and setting this
on the stove, stirring constantly to keep it
from burning black. Or a better way is, to
set the tin plate in a hot oven, opening the
door now and then to stir it. It is a good
plan to brown a good deal—say a cupful of
flour—at a time, and keep it in a glass jar
for thickening gravies, etc.</p>

<p>Wet up a heaping tablespoonful of this with
three tablespoonfuls of cold water, the lemon-juice,
mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Rub
smooth and stir well into the stew. Boil two
minutes longer to thicken the gravy and turn
out into a deep covered dish.</p>

<p>This is a good dinner, as well as breakfast
dish. A teaspoonful of catsup is an improvement.</p>

<h2>8<br />

<small>WHAT TO DO WITH “LEFT-OVERS.”</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp; VOLUME, instead of a single chapter,
might be written upon the various
methods of preparing what the French call
“<i>rechauffés</i>,” and we speak of, usually contemptuously,
as “warmed-over” meats. Cold
meat is seldom tempting except to the very
hungry. Cold tongue, ham and poultry are
well enough on picnics and as a side-dish at
tea. At breakfast they are barely admissible;
for a simple luncheon tolerable; for dinner
hardly excusable. At the first and last meal
of the day, the stomach craves something hot
and relishable.</p>

<p>A wife told me, once, with strong disgust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in the remembrance, that when her husband
took her on the wedding-trip to visit his
mother, a frugal Massachusetts matron, they
were set down within half an hour after their
arrival, to lunch on a cold eel-pie left from
the day before. The daughter-in-law, forty
years later, spoke feelingly of the impression
of niggardliness and inhospitality made on her
mind by the incident.</p>

<p>“If she had even warmed it up, I should
not have felt so forlornly homesick,” she said.
“But cold eel-pie! Think of it!”</p>

<p>I confess to heartfelt sympathy with the
complainant. There is a suggestion of friendliness
and home-comfort in the “goodly smell” of
a steaming-hot <i>entrée</i> set before family or guest.
It argues forethought for those who are to
be fed. We have the consciousness that we
are expected and that somebody has cared
enough for us to make ready a visible welcome.
Pale slices of cold mutton, and thin
slabs of corned beef cannot, with the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
intentions on the part of the caterer, convey
this.</p>

<p>The summing up of this lecture, is: Neither
despise unlikely fragments left over from roast,
baked or boiled, nor consider them good enough
as they are without “rehabilitation.”</p>

<p>We will begin with a dish the mention of
which provokes a sneer more often than any
other known to civilization.</p>


<h3>Hash.</h3>

<p>Rid cold corned or roast beef of fat, skin
and gristle, and mince it in a wooden tray
with a sharp chopper until the largest piece
is not more than an eighth of an inch
square.</p>

<p>With two cupfuls of this mix a cupful of
mashed potato rubbed smooth with a potato
beater or wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Season well with pepper and salt if the
beef be fresh, if corned use the salt sparingly
and pepper well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Set a clean frying-pan on the stove with a
cupful of beef gravy in it from which you
have skimmed all the fat. Clear soup will do
if you have no gravy. If you have neither,
pour into the pan a half-pint of boiling water
and stir into this three tablespoonfuls of butter.
When the butter-water (or gravy) reaches
the boil, add a half-teaspoonful of made mustard.</p>

<p>Then put in the meat and potato and stir—scraping
the bottom of the pan to prevent
sticking—for five minutes, or until you have
a bubbling-hot mass, not stiff, nor yet semi-liquid.
It must have been brought to boiling
heat and kept at it about five minutes, cooking
so fast that you have to stir and toss
constantly lest it should scorch.</p>

<p>Heap on a hot dish, and eat from hot
plates.</p>


<h3>Hash Cakes.</h3>

<p>Having prepared the hash as above set it
aside until cold, when mould into flat cakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as you would sausage meat, and roll in flour.
Heat nice beef-dripping to a boil in a frying-pan,
lay in the cakes, and fry to a light
brown on both sides.</p>


<h3>Beef Croquettes.</h3>

<p>You can make these of the cold hash by
moulding it into rolls about three and a half
inches long, and rather more than an inch in
diameter. Roll these over and over on a
floured dish or board to get them smooth and
regular in shape; flatten the ends by setting
each upright on the floury dish, and put enough
dripping in the pan to cover them as they lie
on their sides in it. It should be <i>very</i> hot
before they go in.</p>

<p>Roll over carefully in the fat as they brown,
not to spoil the shape. Do not put too many
in the pan at once; as fast as they are done
take them up and lay in a hot colander until
all are ready. Arrange neatly on a heated flat
dish and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>A Mutton Stew.</h3>

<p>Cut slices of cold mutton half an inch
thick, trim away fat and skin and divide the
lean meat into neat squares about an inch
across.</p>

<p>Drop a piece of onion as large as a hickory-nut
in a cupful of water and boil fifteen
minutes. Strain the water through a bit of
muslin, squeezing the onion hard to extract
the flavor. Allow this cupful of water to two
cupfuls of meat. If you have less mutton use
less water; if more increase the quantity of
liquid.</p>

<p>Pour the water into a clean saucepan and
when it boils add two full tablespoonfuls of
butter cut into bits and rolled over and over
in browned flour until no more will adhere to
the butter.</p>

<p>Stir this in with a little pepper and salt, a
pinch of mace and a teaspoonful of lemon-juice.
Boil up once and drop in the meat.
Cover closely and let it simmer at one side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the stove, almost, but never <i>quite</i> boiling,
for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Turn into a deep dish and serve very hot.</p>


<h3>Minced Mutton on Toast.</h3>

<p>Trim off skin and fat from slices of cold
mutton and mince in a chopping-tray. Season
with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Into a clean frying-pan, pour a cupful of
mutton-gravy which has been skimmed well,
mixed with a little hot water and strained
through a bit of coarse muslin.</p>

<p>When this boils, wet a teaspoonful of
browned flour with three tablespoonfuls of cold
water, and a teaspoonful of tomato or walnut
catsup, or half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce. Rub out all the lumps and stir into
the gravy in the frying-pan. Boil up once
well before putting in the mutton.</p>

<p>As soon as the mixture bubbles and smokes
all over, draw it to one side of the range
where it will keep hot, but not quite boil;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cover it closely, and let it stand five minutes.
Warmed-over mutton becomes insipid when
cooked too much.</p>

<p>Before the mince is put into the pan, toast
the bread. Cut thick slices from a stale loaf,
and trim off the crust. If you would have
them look particularly nice, cut them round with
a cake or biscuit-cutter. Toast to a light-brown,
and keep hot until the mince is
cooked.</p>

<p>Then lay the toast on a heated platter;
butter the rounds well on both sides, and
pour on each a tablespoonful of <i>boiling</i> water.
Heap a great spoonful of the minced mutton
on each piece.</p>

<p>The mince should not be a stiff paste, nor
yet so soft as to run all over the dish.
A cupful of gravy will be enough for three
cupfuls of meat.</p>

<p>Some people fancy a little green pickle or
chow chow chopped very fine and mixed
in with the mince while cooking. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
think the dish improved by the addition
of a teaspoonful of lemon-juice put in just
before taking it from the fire.</p>


<h3>Devilled Mutton.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Cut even slices of cold mutton, not too
fat.</p>

<p>Stir together and melt in a clean frying-pan
two tablespoonfuls of butter and
one of currant or grape jelly.</p>

<p>When it hisses lay in the mutton and
heat slowly—turning several times—for
five minutes, or until the slices
are soft and very hot, but not until
they begin to crisp.</p>

<p>Take out the meat, lay on a warmed
dish, cover and set over boiling
water.</p>

<p>To the butter and jelly left in the pan
add three tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>A small teaspoonful of made mustard.</p>

<p>A quarter spoonful of salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Half as much pepper as you have salt.</p>

<p>Stir together over the fire until they boil,
and pour on the meat. Cover three
minutes over boiling water, and serve.</p></div>


<p>Devilled, or Barbecued Ham.</p>

<p>Slice cold Ferris &amp; Co.’s “Trade Mark” ham,
lean and fat together, and lay in a clean frying-pan.
Fry gently in the grease that runs from
it as it heats, until the lean is soft, the fat
clear and beginning to crisp at the edges.</p>

<p>Take out the slices with a fork, lay on a
warmed dish; keep hot over boiling water.</p>

<p>Add to the fat left in the frying-pan:</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Four tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>A small teaspoonful of made mustard.</p>

<p>As much pepper as will lie <i>easily</i> on
a silver half-dime.</p>

<p>Stir until it boils, then pour on the ham.
Let it stand covered over the boiling
water for five minutes before sending
to the table.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<h3>Chicken Croquettes.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One cup of cold chicken, minced fine.</p>

<p>One quarter cup of pounded cracker.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of cornstarch, wet up in
a <i>little</i> cold water.</p>

<p>One egg.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Half a tablespoonful of salt.</p>

<p>A good pinch of pepper.</p>

<p>Half a cupful of boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix minced chicken and crumbs together
in a bowl with salt and pepper.</p></div>

<p>Put the boiling water in a clean saucepan,
add the butter and set over the fire. When
the butter is melted stir in the wet corn
starch. Boil and stir until it thickens.</p>

<p>Have the egg beaten light in a bowl and
pour the hot mixture upon it. Beat well, and
mix with the minced chicken. Let it get perfectly
cold and make into croquettes as directed
for beef croquettes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>But roll these in a well-beaten egg, then in
fine cracker-crumbs instead of flour, and fry, a
few at a time, in a mixture half-butter, half-lard
enough to cover them well. Drain off every
drop of fat from each croquette as you take
it up, and keep hot until all are done.</p>

<p>Serve hot and at once.</p>

<h2>9<br />

<small>DINNER DISHES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; AM amused and yet made thoughtful by
the fact that so many young housekeepers
write to me of their pleasure in cake-making
and their desire to learn how to compound
what are usually known as “fancy-dishes,”
some sending excellent receipts for loaf-cake,
cookies and doughnuts, while few express the
least interest in soups, meats and vegetables.
The drift of the dear creatures’ thoughts reminds
me of a rhymed—“If I had!” which I
read years ago, setting forth how a little boy
would have if he could, a house built of
pastry, floored with taffy, ceiled with sugar-plums,
and roofed with frosted gingerbread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
In engaging a cook one does not ask, first
of all, “Can you get up handsome desserts?”
but, “Do you understand bread-making and
baking, and the management of meats, soups,
and other branches of plain cookery?”</p>

<p>The same “plain cookery” is the pivot on
which the family health and comfort rest and
turn. If you would qualify yourselves to become
thorough housewives, it is as essential
that you should master the principles of this,
as that a musician should be able to read
the notes on the staff. Some people do play
tolerably by ear, but they are never ranked
as students, much less as professors of music.
“Fancy” cookery is to the real thing what
embroidery is to the art of the seamstress.
She who has learned how to use her needle
deftly upon “seam, gusset and band,” will
find the acquisition of ornamental stitches an
easy matter. Skill in Kensington and satin
stitch is of little value in fitting one to do
“fine,” which is also useful sewing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I am sorry to add that my observation
goes to prove that more American housekeepers
can make delicate and rich cake than
excellent soups.</p>


<h3>Soup Stock.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two pounds coarse lean beef, chopped almost
as fine as sausage-meat.</p>

<p>One pound of lean veal—also chopped.</p>

<p>Two pounds of bones (beef, veal, or mutton)
cracked in several places.</p>

<p>Half an onion chopped.</p>

<p>Two or three stalks of celery, when you
can get it.</p>

<p>Five quarts of cold water.</p></div>

<p>Meat and bones should be raw, but if you
have bones left from underdone beef or mutton,
you may crack and add them. Put all
the ingredients (no salt or pepper) in a large
clean pot, cover it closely and set at one side
of the range where it will not get really hot
under two hours. This gives the water time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to draw out the juices of the meat. Then
remove to a warmer place, stir up well from
the bottom, and cook slowly five hours longer.</p>

<p>It should never boil hard, but “bubble-bubble”
softly and steadily all the while. Fast
boiling toughens the fibres and keeps in the
juice of the meat which should form the body
of the soup. When the time is up, lift the
pot from the fire, throw in a heaping tablespoonful
of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper,
and pour out into your “stock-pot.” This
should be a stout stone crock or jar, with
a cover, and be used for nothing else.</p>

<p>See that it is free from grease, dust and
all smell, scald out with hot water and soda,
then with clean boiling water just before pouring
in the soup, or the hot liquid may crack it.</p>

<p>Put on the cover and set in a cold place
until next day.</p>

<p>Then take off every particle of the caked
fat from the top. You can use this as dripping
for frying. Soup that has globules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
grease floating on the surface is unwholesome
and slovenly.</p>

<p>Strain the skimmed liquid through a colander,
squeezing the meat hard to extract every drop
of nutriment. Throw away the tasteless fibres
and bones when you have wrung them dry.</p>

<p>This process should give you about three
quarts of strong “stock.”</p>

<p>Rinse your jar well and pour back the
strained stock into it to be used as the foundation
of several days’ soups. Season it highly
and keep in a cold place—in warm weather
on the ice.</p>

<p>I hope you will not fail to set up a “stock-pot.”
Every family should have one. It makes
the matter of really good soups simple and
easy.</p>


<h3>Clear Soup with Sago or Tapioca.</h3>

<p>Soak half a cup of German sago or pearl
tapioca four hours in a large cup of cold
water. An hour before dinner put a quart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of your soup-stock on the stove and bring
quickly almost to a boil. When it is hot, stir
in the raw white and the shell of an egg,
and, stirring frequently to prevent the egg
from catching on the bottom of the pot, boil
fast ten minutes.</p>

<p>Take off and strain through a clean thick
cloth, wrung out in hot water and laid like a
lining in your colander. Do not squeeze the
cloth, or you will muddy the soup.</p>

<p>Return the liquid, when strained, to the
saucepan, which must be perfectly clean; stir
in the soaked tapioca and a teaspoonful of
minced parsley, and simmer half an hour on
the side of the range.</p>

<p>If necessary, add a little more seasoning.</p>

<p>When you have made nice clear soup once,
you may, if you like, color the second supply
with a little “caramel-water.”</p>

<p>This is made by putting a tablespoonful of
sugar in a tin cup and setting it over the fire
until it breaks up into brown bubbles, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
pouring a few tablespoonfuls of boiling water
on it and stirring it until dissolved. A tablespoonful
of this in a quart of clear soup will
give a fine amber color and not injure the
flavor. Send all soups in to table very hot.</p>


<h3>Julienne Soup.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quarter of a firm white cabbage, shred
as for cold slaw.</p>

<p>One small turnip, peeled and cut into
thin dice.</p>

<p>One carrot, peeled and cut into strips like
inch-long straws.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of onion shred fine.</p>

<p>Three raw tomatoes, peeled and cut into
bits.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of minced parsley, and,
if you can get it, three stalks of celery
cut into thin slices.</p></div>

<p>Use a sharp knife for this work and bruise
the vegetables as little as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>When all are prepared, put them in hot
water enough to cover them, throw in a teaspoonful
of salt and cook gently half an hour.</p>

<p>Clear a quart of soup-stock as directed in
the last receipt, and color it with a teaspoonful
of Halford sauce, or walnut catsup.</p>

<p>When the vegetables are tender, turn them
into a colander to drain, taking care not to
mash or break them. Throw away the water
in which they were boiled, and add the vegetables
to the clear hot soup.</p>

<p>Taste, to determine if it needs more pepper
or salt, and simmer all together gently twenty
minutes before turning into the tureen.</p>


<h3>White Chicken Soup (Delicious).</h3>

<p>A tough fowl can be converted into very
delicious dishes by boiling it first for soup
and mincing it, when cold, for croquettes.</p>

<p>In boiling it, allow a quart of cold water
for each pound of chicken, and set it where
it will heat very slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>If the fowl be quite old do not let it
reach a boil under two hours, then boil <i>very</i>
gently four hours longer.</p>

<p>Throw in a tablespoonful of salt when you
take it from the fire, turn chicken and liquor
into a bowl and set in a cold place all night.</p>

<p>Next day skim off the fat, strain the broth
from the chicken, shaking the colander to do
this well, and put aside the meat for croquettes
or a scallop.</p>

<p>Set three pints of the broth over the fire
with a teaspoonful of chopped onion, season
with salt and pepper, and let it boil half an
hour. Line a colander with a thick cloth, and
strain the liquid, squeezing the cloth to get the
flavor of the onion.</p>

<p>Return the strained soup to the saucepan,
with a tablespoonful of minced parsley, and
bring to a boil. Meanwhile, scald in a farina
kettle a cupful of milk, dropping into it a bit
of soda the size of a pea.</p>

<p>Stir into this when hot, a tablespoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
cornstarch wet up with cold milk. When
it thickens scrape it out into a bowl in
which you have two eggs whipped light.
Beat all together well, and stir in, spoonful by
spoonful, a cupful of the boiling soup.</p>

<p>Draw the soup pot to one side of the
range, stir in the contents of the bowl, and
let it stand—but not boil—three minutes
before pouring into the tureen.</p>


<h3>Chicken and Rice Soup</h3>

<p>Is made as white chicken soup, but with the
addition of four tablespoonfuls of rice, boiled
soft, and added to the chicken liquor at the
same time with the parsley. Then proceed as
directed, with milk, eggs, etc.</p>


<h3>Tomato Soup.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Add a quart of raw tomatoes, peeled and
sliced, or a can of stewed tomatoes,
and half a small onion to a quart of
stock, and stew slowly one hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Strain and rub through a colander and set
again over the fire.</p>

<p>Stir in a tablespoonful of butter cut up
and rubbed into a tablespoonful of
flour.</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of cornstarch wet up with
cold water.</p>

<p>Season to taste with pepper and salt,
boil once more and pour out.</p></div>


<p>Bean Soup.</p>

<p>Soak one pint of dried beans all night in
lukewarm water. In the morning add three
quarts of cold water, half a pound of nice
salt pork, cut into strips, half an onion chopped,
and three stalks of celery, cut small. Set at
one side of the fire until it is very hot, then
where it will cook slowly, and let it boil
four hours. Stir up often from the bottom, as
bean-soup is apt to scorch.</p>

<p>An hour before dinner, set a colander over
another pot and rub the bean porridge through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the holes with a stout wooden spoon, leaving
the skins in the colander.</p>

<p>Return the soup to the fire, stir in a tablespoonful
of butter rubbed in a tablespoonful
of flour, and simmer gently fifteen minutes
longer.</p>

<p>Have ready in the tureen a double handful
of strips or squares of stale bread, fried like
doughnuts in dripping, and drained dry. Also,
half a lemon, peeled and sliced very thin.</p>

<p>Pour the soup on these and serve.</p>


<h3>A Soup Maigre (without Meat).</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Twelve mealy potatoes, peeled and sliced.</p>

<p>One quart of tomatoes—canned or fresh.</p>

<p>One half of an onion.</p>

<p>Two stalks of celery.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of minced parsley.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up and
rolled in flour.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of cornstarch wet and
dissolved in cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>One lump of white sugar.</p>

<p>Three quarts of cold water will be needed.</p></div>

<p>Parboil the sliced potatoes fifteen minutes
in enough hot water to cover them well.
Drain this off and throw it away. Put potatoes,
tomatoes, onion, celery and parsley on
in three quarts of cold water, and cook gently
two hours.</p>

<p>Then rub them all through a colander, return
the soup to the pot, drop in the sugar,
season to taste with pepper and salt, boil up
once and take off the scum before adding the
floured butter, and when this is dissolved, the
cornstarch.</p>

<p>Stir two minutes over the fire, and your
soup is ready for the table. Very good it
will prove, too, if the directions be exactly
followed.</p>

<p>When celery is out of season, you can use
instead of it, a little essence of celery, or,
what is better, celery salt.</p>

<h2>10<br />

<small>MEATS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the most comico-pathetico true
stories I know is that of a boy, the
youngest of a large family, who, having always
sat at the second table, knew nothing experimentally
of the choicer portions of chicken or
turkey. Being invited out to dinner as the
guest of a playmate, he was asked, first of all
present, “what part of the turkey he preferred.”</p>

<p>“The <i>carker</i>” (carcass), “and a little of the
<i>stuff</i>” (stuffing), “if you please,” replied the
poor little fellow, with prompt politeness.</p>

<p>It was his usual ration, and in his ignorance,
he craved nothing better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The pupil in cookery who enjoys tossing up
<i>entrées</i>, and devising dainty <i>rechauffés</i>, but cannot
support the thought of handling raw
chickens and big-boned joints of butcher’s
meat, is hardly wiser than he.</p>

<p>It is a common fallacy to believe that this
branch of the culinary art is uninteresting
drudgery, fit only for the hands of the very
plain hired cook.</p>

<p>Another mistake, almost as prevalent, lies in
supposing that she can, of course, perform the
duty properly. There is room for intelligent
skill in so simple a process as roasting a
piece of meat, nor is the task severe or
repulsive. Practically, it is far more important
to know how to do this well, than to be proficient
in cake, jelly, and pudding making.</p>


<h3>Roast Beef.</h3>

<p>Have a steady, moderate fire in the stove-grate.
Increase the heat when the meat is
thoroughly warmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay the beef, skin side uppermost, in a clean
baking-pan, and dash all over it two cups
of <i>boiling</i> water in which a teaspoonful of salt
has been dissolved. This sears the surface
slightly, and keeps in the juices.</p>

<p>Shut the oven door, and do not open again
for twenty minutes. Then, with a ladle or
iron spoon dip up the salted water and pour
it over the top of the meat, wetting every
part again and again. Eight or ten ladlefuls
should be used in this “basting,” which should
be repeated every fifteen minutes for the next
hour. Allow twelve minutes to each pound of
meat in roasting beef.</p>

<p>Do not swing the oven door wide while you
baste, but slip your hand (protected by an old
glove or a napkin) into the space left by the
half-open door, and when you have wet the
surface of the roast quickly and well, shut it
up again to heat and steam.</p>

<p>A little care in this respect will add much
to the flavor and tenderness of the beef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Should one side of it, or the back, brown
more rapidly than the rest, turn the pan in
the oven, and should the water dry up
to a few spoonfuls, pour in another cupful
from the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes before the time for
the roasting is up, draw the pan to the oven-door,
and sift flour over the meat from a flour
dredger or a small sieve. Shut the door until
the flour browns, then baste abundantly, and
dredge again.</p>

<p>In five minutes, or when this dredging is
brown, rub the top of the meat with a good
teaspoonful of butter, dredge quickly and close
the door.</p>

<p>If the fire is good, in a few minutes a
nice brown froth will encrust the surface of
the cooked meat. Lift the pan to the side
table, take up the beef by slipping a strong
cake-turner or broad knife under it, holding it
firmly with a fork, and transfer to a heated
platter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Set in the plate-warmer, or over boiling
water, while you make the gravy.</p>


<h3>Gravy (brown).</h3>

<p>Set the pan in which the meat was roasted,
<i>on</i> the range when the beef has been removed
to a dish. Scrape toward the centre the
browned flour from sides and bottom and dust
in a little more from your dredger as you
stir. If the water has boiled away until the
bottom of the pan is exposed, add a little,
<i>boiling hot</i>, directly from the teakettle and
stir until the gravy is of the consistency of
rich cream.</p>

<p>Pepper to taste and pour into a gravy boat.</p>

<p>While I give these directions, I may remark
that few people of nice taste like <i>made</i> thickened
gravy with roast beef. Many prefer, instead,
the red essence which follows the
carver’s knife and settles in the dish. The
carver should give each person helped his or
her choice in this matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>I am thus explicit with regard to roasting
beef because the process is substantially the
same with all meats. Dash scalding water
over the piece put down for cooking in this
way: heat rather slowly at first, increasing
the heat as you go on; baste faithfully; keep
the oven open as little as may be and dredge,
then baste, alternately, for twenty minutes, or
so, before dishing the meat.</p>


<h3>Roast Mutton.</h3>

<p>Cook exactly as you would beef: but if you
wish a made gravy, pour it first from the
baking-pan into a bowl and set in cold water
five minutes, or until the fat has risen to the
top.</p>

<p>Skim off all of this that you can remove
without disturbing the dregs. It is “mutton-tallow”—very
good for chapped hands, but
not for human stomachs. Return the gravy to
the fire, thicken, add boiling water, if needed,
and stir until smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Always send currant, or grape jelly, around
with mutton and lamb.</p>


<h3>Roast Lamb.</h3>

<p>Cook two minutes less in the pound than
you would mutton. Instead of gravy, you can
send in with it, if you choose</p>


<h3>Mint Sauce.</h3>

<p>To two tablespoonfuls of chopped mint, add
a tablespoonful of white sugar and nearly two
thirds of a cup of vinegar. Let them stand
together ten minutes in a cool place before
sending to table.</p>


<h3>Roast Veal</h3>

<p>Must be cooked twice as long as beef or
mutton, and very well basted, the flesh being
fibrous and dry. To the made gravy add two
teaspoonfuls of stewed and strained tomato, or
one tablespoonful of tomato catsup, and cook
one minute before pouring into the gravy-boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<h3>Roast Turkey, Chicken or Duck.</h3>

<p>It would not be possible for me to write
such directions as would enable you to prepare
a fowl for cooking. Yet I advise you to
learn how to draw and dress poultry. Watch
the process closely, if you have opportunity, or
else ask some experienced friend to instruct you.</p>

<p>For the present we will suppose that our
fowl is ready for the roasting pan. Lay it in
tenderly, breast uppermost, pour a bountiful
cup of boiling water, slightly salted, over it,
if it be a chicken or duck, two cupfuls, if a
turkey, and roast, basting often, about twelve
minutes for each pound. When the breastbone
browns, turn the fowl on one side, and as
this colors, on the other, that all may be
done evenly. Dredge once with flour fifteen
minutes before taking up the roast and when
this browns, rub all over with a tablespoonful
of butter. Shut up ten minutes longer and it
is ready for dishing.</p>

<p>Chop the liver and soft parts of the gizzard—which
have been roasted with the fowl—fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and stir into the gravy while you are
making it.</p>


<h3>Fricasseed Chicken.</h3>

<p>Cut up a full-grown fowl into joints, dividing
the back and breast into two pieces each.
Lay these in cold water, slightly salted, for
half an hour. Wipe dry with a clean cloth.
In the bottom of a pot scatter a handful
of chopped fat salt pork, with half a teaspoonful
of minced onion. On this lay the pieces
of chicken. Sprinkle a double handful of pork
on the top with another half teaspoonful of
onion, pour in carefully, enough cold water to
cover all, fit on a close top, and set the pot
where it will heat slowly. It should not boil
under one hour at least. Increase the heat,
then, but keep at a <i>very</i> gentle boil for
another hour, or until the chicken is tender.
The time needed for cooking will depend on
the age of the fowl. Fast stewing will harden
and toughen it.</p>

<p>When done, take out the chicken with a
fork and arrange on a warm dish, covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and keeping it hot in the plate warmer or
over boiling water. Add to the gravy left in
the pot two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley,
a heaping tablespoonful of butter cut up in
the same quantity of flour, half a teaspoonful
of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of
pepper. Stir to a boil. Meanwhile, beat up
an egg in a bowl, add a teaspoonful of cornstarch,
and a small cupful of milk, and when
these are mixed, a cupful of the boiling gravy.
Beat hard and pour into the pot where is the
rest of the gravy. Bring to a quick boil, take
<i>at once</i> from the fire and pour over the
chicken. Cover and let it stand over hot
water three minutes before sending to table.</p>


<h3>Smothered Chicken.</h3>

<p>The chicken must be split down the back
as for broiling, washed well and wiped dry.
Lay it, breast upward, in a baking pan; pour
in two cups of boiling water, in which has been
dissolved a heaping tablespoonful of butter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and cover with another pan turned upside
down and fitting exactly the edges of the
lower one. Cook slowly half an hour, lift the
cover and baste plentifully with the butter
water in the pan; cover again and leave for
twenty minutes more. Baste again, and yet
once more in another quarter of an hour.
Try the chicken with a fork to see if it is
done.</p>

<p>An hour and ten minutes should be enough
for a young fowl. Baste the last time with a
tablespoonful of butter; cover and leave in
the oven ten minutes longer before transferring
to a hot dish. It should be of a fine
yellow brown all over, but crisped nowhere.</p>

<p>Thicken the gravy with a tablespoonful of
browned flour, wet up in a little water, salt
and pepper to taste, boil up once and pour
a cupful over the chicken, the rest into a
gravy boat.</p>

<p>There is no more delightful preparation of
chicken than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>Boiled Corn Beef.</h3>

<p>Lay in clean cold water for five or six
hours when you have washed off all the salt.
Wipe and put it into a pot and cover deep
in cold water. Boil <i>gently</i> twenty-five minutes
per pound. When done, take the pot from
the fire and set in the sink with the meat in
it, while you make the sauce.</p>

<p>Strain a large cupful of the liquor into a
saucepan and set it over the fire. Wet a
tablespoonful of flour up with cold water, and
when the liquor boils, stir it in with a great
spoonful of butter. Beat it smooth before
adding the juice of a lemon. Serve in a gravy-dish.
Take up the beef, letting all the liquor
drain from it, and send in on a hot platter.</p>

<p>(Save the pot-liquor for bean soup.)</p>


<h3>Boiled Mutton.</h3>

<p>Sew up the leg of mutton in a stout piece
of mosquito net or of “cheese cloth;” lay it
in a pot and cover several inches deep with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
boiling water. Throw in a tablespoonful of
salt, and cook twelve minutes to the pound.
Take up the cloth with the meat in it and
dip in <i>very</i> cold water. Remove the bag and
dish the meat.</p>

<p>Before taking up the mutton, make your
sauce, using as a base a cupful of the liquor
dipped from the pot. Proceed with this as
you did with the drawn butter sauce for the
corned beef, but instead of the lemon juice,
add two tablespoonfuls of capers if you have
them. If not, the same quantity of chopped
green pickle.</p>

<h2>11<br />

<small>VEGETABLES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN attempting to make out under the above
heading, a list of receipts, I have laid
down my pen several times in sheer discouragement.
The number and variety of esculents
supplied by the American market-gardener
would need for a just mention of each, a treatise
several times larger than our volume. I
have, therefore, selected a few of the vegetables
in general use on our tables, and given
the simplest and most approved methods of
preparing them.</p>

<p>As a preface I transcribe from “Common
Sense in the Household” “<span class="smcap">Rules applicable
to the cooking of all Vegetables</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Have them as fresh as possible.</p>

<p>Pick over, wash well, and cut out all decayed
parts.</p>

<p>Lay them when peeled in <i>cold</i> water before
cooking.</p>

<p>If you boil them put a little salt in the
water.</p>

<p>Cook steadily after you put them on.</p>

<p>Be sure they are thoroughly done.</p>

<p><i>Drain well.</i></p>

<p>Serve hot!</p>


<h3>Potatoes (boiled).</h3>

<p>Pare them thin with a sharp knife. The
starch or meal lies, in greatest quantities,
nearest to the skin. Lay in clean cold water
for one hour, if the potatoes are newly gathered.
Old potatoes should be left in the water
for several hours. If very old, they will be
the better for soaking all night. New potatoes
require half an hour for boiling, and the skins
are rubbed off with a coarse cloth before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
are cooked. Those stored for winter use should
be boiled forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Wipe each dry before dropping them into a
kettle of boiling water, in which has been
mixed a heaping tablespoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Boil steadily until a fork will go easily into
the largest.</p>

<p>Turn off the water by tipping the pot over
on its side in the sink, holding the top on
with a thick cloth wrapped about your hand,
and leaving room at the lowest edge of the
cover for the water to escape, but not for a
potato to slip through.</p>

<p>Set the pot uncovered on the range; sprinkle
a tablespoonful of salt over the potatoes, shaking
the pot as you do this, and leave it where
they will dry off, but not scorch, for five
minutes.</p>


<h3>Mashed Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Boil as directed in last receipt, and when
the potatoes have been dried off, remove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pot to the sink, or table, break and whip
them into powder with a four-tined fork, or a
split spoon. When fine, add a great spoonful
of butter, whipped in thoroughly, salting to
taste as you go on.</p>

<p>Have ready a cup of milk <i>almost</i> boiling,
and beat in until the potato is soft and smooth.</p>

<p>Heap in a deep dish for the table.</p>


<h3>Onions (boiled).</h3>

<p>Remove the outer layers until you reach
the sleek, silvery, crisp skins. Cook in plenty
of boiling, salted water, until tender. Forty
minutes should be sufficient, unless the onions
are very old and large. Turn off all the
water; add a cupful from the tea-kettle with
one of warm milk and stew gently ten minutes.</p>

<p>Heat, meanwhile, in a saucepan, half a cupful
of milk with a large tablespoonful of
butter.</p>

<p>Drain the onions in a hot <i>clean</i> colander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
turn them into a heated deep dish, salt and
pepper lightly, and pour the boiling milk and
butter over them.</p>

<p>Onions cooked thus are not nearly so rank
of flavor as when boiled in but one water.</p>


<h3>Tomatoes (stewed).</h3>

<p>Put ripe tomatoes into a pan, pour boiling
water directly from the kettle, upon them, and
cover closely for five minutes. The skins will
then come off easily.</p>

<p>When all are peeled, cut them up, throwing
away the unripe parts and the cores, and put
them into a clean saucepan with half a teaspoonful
of salt.</p>

<p>Stew twenty minutes before adding a heaping
tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of
white sugar (for a dozen large tomatoes) and
a little pepper. Stew gently fifteen minutes,
and serve.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Scald, skin, and cut each crosswise, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
two or three pieces. <i>Just</i> melt a teaspoonful
of butter in a pie-plate, or pudding-dish, and
put into this a layer of tomatoes. Lay a bit
of butter on each slice, sprinkle lightly with
salt, pepper, and white sugar, and cover with
fine dry cracker, or bread crumbs. Fill the
dish with alternate layers of tomato crumbs,
having a thick coating of crumbs on the top,
and sticking tiny “dabs” of butter all over it.</p>

<p>Bake, covered, half an hour. Take off the tin
pan, or whatever you have used to keep in
the steam, and brown nicely before sending to
table.</p>


<h3>Beets.</h3>

<p>Wash well, taking care not to scratch the
skin, as they will “bleed” while in cooking
if this is cut or broken.</p>

<p>Cook in boiling water an hour and a half
if young, three, four or five hours as their
age increases.</p>

<p>Drain, scrape off the skins, slice quickly
with a sharp knife; put into a vegetable dish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and pour over them a half a cupful of vinegar,
with two tablespoonfuls of butter, heated to
boiling, and a little salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Let them stand three minutes covered in a
warm place before serving.</p>


<h3>Green Peas.</h3>

<p>Shell and leave in very cold water fifteen
minutes. Cook in plenty of boiling, salted
water. They should be done in half an hour.</p>

<p>Shake gently in a hot colander to get rid
of the water; turn into a heated deep dish,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and stir in fast
and lightly <i>with a fork</i>, two tablespoonfuls of
butter.</p>

<p>Eat while hot.</p>


<h3>String Beans.</h3>

<p>Do not cook these at all unless you are willing
to take the trouble of “stringing” them.</p>

<p>With a small sharp knife cut off the stem
and blossom-tips, then trim away the tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fibres from the sides carefully, and cut each
bean into inch-lengths.</p>

<p>Lay in cold water for half an hour. Cook
one hour in salted boiling water, or until the
beans are tender.</p>

<p>Drain, butter and season as you would
peas.</p>

<p>String beans half-trimmed and cut into
slovenly, unequal lengths are a vulgar-looking,
unpopular dish. Prepared as I have directed,
they are comely, palatable and wholesome.</p>


<h3>Squash.</h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, take out the seeds, and lay in
cold water for half an hour.</p>

<p>Boil in hot salted water thirty minutes for
summer squash; twice as long if the “Hubbard”
or other varieties of winter squash are
used. Take up piece by piece, and squeeze
gently in a clean cloth, put back into the
empty dried pot, and mash quickly and smoothly
with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter for
one large squash, or two small ones.</p>

<p>Season with pepper and salt; heat and stir
until smoking hot, then dish and serve.</p>


<h3>Cauliflower.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Trim off leaves and cut the stalk short.</p>

<p>Lay in ice-cold water for half an hour.</p>

<p>Tie it up in a bit of white netting.</p>

<p>Put into a clean pot, cover <i>deep</i> with
salted boiling water.</p>

<p>Boil steadily, not hard, one hour and ten
minutes.</p></div>

<p>Before taking it from the fire, put a cupful
of boiling water in a saucepan.</p>

<p>Wet a heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch with
cold water, and stir into the boiling until it
thickens. Then add two tablespoonfuls of butter,
and when this is well stirred in, the strained
juice of a lemon.</p>

<p>Remove the net from the cauliflower, lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a deep dish, and pour over it the drawn
butter made by the addition of the lemon
juice into <i>sauce tartare</i>.</p>


<h3>Egg Plant.</h3>

<p>Slice it crosswise, and about an inch thick;
lay in strong salt water for one hour with a
plate on the topmost slice to keep it under the
brine.</p>

<p>This will draw out the bitter taste.</p>

<p>Put a cupful of pounded crackers into a flat
dish and season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks of two eggs in a shallow
bowl. Wipe each slice of the egg plant <i>dry</i>,
dip it in the egg, and roll it over and over in
the crumbs. Have ready heated in a frying-pan,
some sweet lard, and fry the vegetables in
it to a fine brown.</p>

<p>As each slice is done, lay it in a hot
colander set in the open oven, that every
drop of grease may be dried off. Serve on a
hot platter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3>Spinach.</h3>

<p>Wash very carefully, leaf by leaf, to get rid
of sand and dust. Lay in very cold water
until you are ready to cook it. Boil forty-five
minutes; drain in a colander and chop <i>fine</i> in
a wooden tray. Beat then three great tablespoonfuls
of butter (this for a peck of
spinach), a teaspoonful of white sugar, and half
as much salt, with a little pepper. Whip all
to a soft green mass and return to the empty
pot.</p>

<p>As you stir it over the fire add a cupful of
rich milk—cream, if you have it—whip up
hard and turn into a deep dish.</p>

<p>Cut two hard-boiled eggs into thin slices,
and lay in order on the spinach when dished.</p>

<h2>12<br />

<small>DESSERTS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ENGLISH cooks would call this “A Chapter
on Sweets.” “<i>Dessert</i>” with them
is usually applied to fruits, nuts, etc. Webster
defines the word thus:</p>

<p>“A service of pastry, fruit or sweetmeats at
the close of an entertainment; the last course
at the table after the meat.”</p>

<p>Without dwelling upon the fact that when
fruit and coffee are served they follow pastry
or puddings or sweetmeats, we take advantage
of the elastic definition and assume that the
dessert of the family dinner is a single preparation
of “sweets.”</p>

<p>The too-universal <span class="smcap">PIE</span> will not appear on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>menu</i>. I am tempted to wish its manufacture
might soon be numbered among the lost arts.</p>

<p>Bayard Taylor once said that “If Rum had
slain its thousands in America, Pork-fat (fried)
and Pies had slain their ten thousands.”</p>

<p>The average pastry of our beloved land
would drive a Patrick Henry to self-exile if he
were obliged to eat it every day. Nor could
one of a dozen inexperienced cooks manipulate
puff-paste as it should be handled in order to
be flaky and tender. Dexterity of motion and
strength of wrist are needed for this operation,
such as belong only to the trained cook.</p>

<p>The more wholesome and daintier jellies,
custards and trifles, and plain puddings we
have selected from the vast variety of sweet
things known to our housewives, are adapted
to the powers of novices in cookery, and not
unworthy the attention of adepts.</p>


<h3>Boiled Custard.</h3>

<p>This is the base of so many nice “fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dishes,” and is itself so excellent and popular
that we may properly lay the knowledge how
to prepare it properly as the foundation-stone
of dessert making.</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One quart of fresh, sweet milk.</p>

<p>Five eggs.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One quarter teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, lemon
or bitter almond.</p></div>

<p>Heat the milk to a boil in a farina kettle,
or in a tin pail set in a pot of boiling water.</p>

<p>In warm weather put a bit of soda no larger
than a pea in the milk. While it is heating
beat the eggs in a bowl. When the milk is
scalding, add the salt and sugar, and pour
the hot liquid upon the eggs, stirring all the
while. Beat up well and return to the inner
vessel, keeping the water in the outer at a
hard boil. Stir two or three times in the
first five minutes; afterward, almost constantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour it <i>ought</i> to be done,
but of this you can only judge by close observation
and practice.</p>

<p>The color changes from deep to creamy
yellow; the consistency to a soft richness that
makes it drop slowly and heavily from the
spoon, and the mixture <i>tastes</i> like a custard
instead of uncooked eggs, sugar and milk.</p>

<p>When you have done it right once, you
recognize these signs ever afterward.</p>

<p>If underdone, the custard will be crude and
watery; if overdone, it will clot or break.</p>

<p>Take it when quite right—just at the turn—directly
from the fire, and pour into a bowl
to cool, before flavoring with the essence.</p>

<p>With a good boiled custard as the beginning
we can make scores of delightful desserts.
First among these we may place</p>


<h3>Cup Custard.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Fill small glasses nearly to the top with
cold custard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Whip the whites of three eggs stiff.</p>

<p>Beat in three teaspoonfuls of bright-colored
jelly-currant, if you have it.</p>

<p>Heap a tablespoon of this <i>méringue</i> on the
surface of each glassful.</p>

<p>Set in a cold place until it goes to table.</p></div>


<p>Floating Island.</p>

<p>Fill a glass bowl almost to the top with
cold boiled custard and cover with a <i>méringue</i>
made as in last receipt. Do not whip in the
jelly so thoroughly as to color the frothed
whites.</p>

<p>It is a prettier dish when the bright red
specks just dot the snowy mass.</p>


<h3>Frosted Custard.</h3>

<p>Make a nice custard; let it get perfectly
cold, and pile on it, instead of the whipped egg,
a large cupful of grated cocoanut, sprinkling
it on carefully, not to disturb the custard.</p>

<p>Eat with sponge cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>Blanc-mange.</h3>

<p>Like custard, this is the base—the central
idea, or fact—of numberless elegant compounds,
and is delightful in its simplest form.</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One package of Cooper’s gelatine.</p>

<p>Three pints of fresh, sweet milk.</p>

<p>One even cupful of white sugar.</p>

<p>One half teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of vanilla or other essence.</p>

<p>Soda as large as a pea, put into the milk.</p></div>

<p>Soak the gelatine three hours in a cupful of
cold water. Then heat the milk (salted) in a
farina kettle.</p>

<p>When it is scalding, stir in without taking
the vessel from the fire, the sugar and soaked
gelatine. Stir three minutes after it is boiling
hot, and strain through a coarse cloth into a
bowl. Let it get almost cold before adding
the flavoring. Wet a clean mould with cold
water; pour in the blanc-mange and set on
ice, or in a cold place until firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Dip a cloth in hot water, wring until it
will not drip, wrap about the mould, turn
bottom upward on a flat dish, and shake gently
to dislodge the contents.</p>

<p>Eat with powdered sugar and cream.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Custard.</h3>

<p>Five minutes before taking the custard from
the fire, add to it three heaping tablespoonful
of grated Baker’s chocolate rubbed to a paste
with a little cold milk. Stir until the mixture
is of a rich coffee color.</p>

<p>Turn out, and when cold, flavor with vanilla
and put into glasses.</p>

<p>Whip the whites of three eggs to a smooth
<i>méringue</i>, beat in three tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar, and heap upon the brown mixture.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Blanc-mange.</h3>

<p>(Our French scholars will say that this
should be termed “<i>Brun-mange</i>.”)</p>

<p>Mix with the soaked gelatine four heaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of Baker’s chocolate, grated, and stir
into the scalding milk, and treat as above directed.
In straining, squeeze the bag hard to
extract all the coloring matter. Flavor with
vanilla.</p>


<h3>Coffee Blanc-mange.</h3>

<p>Soak the gelatine in a cupful of strong,
clear black coffee, instead of the cold water, and
proceed as with plain blanc-mange, using no
other flavoring than the coffee.</p>


<h3>Tea Blanc-mange</h3>

<p>Is made in the same way by substituting for
the water very strong, mixed tea. Eat with
powdered sugar and cream.</p>


<h3>Pineapple Trifle.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One package of gelatine.</p>

<p>Two cups of white sugar.</p>

<p>One small pineapple, peeled and cut into
bits.</p>

<p>One-half teaspoonful of nutmeg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Juice and grated peel of a lemon.</p>

<p>Three cups of <i>boiling</i> water.</p>

<p>Whites of four eggs.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine four hours in a cup of
cold water.</p>

<p>Put into a bowl with the sugar, nutmeg,
lemon-juice, and rind and minced
pineapple.</p></div>

<p>Rub the fruit hard into the mixture with a
wooden spoon, and let all stand together,
covered, two hours.</p>

<p>Then pour upon it the boiling water and
stir until the gelatine is dissolved.</p>

<p>Line a colander with a double thickness of
clean flannel, and strain the mixture through
it, squeezing and wringing the cloth hard, to
get the full flavor of the fruit. Set on ice
until cold, but not until it is hard.</p>

<p>It should be just “jellied” around the
edges, when you begin to whip the whites
of the eggs in a bowl set in ice water. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they are quite stiff, beat in a spoonful at a
time the gelatine. Whip a minute after adding
each supply to mix it in perfectly.</p>

<p>Half an hour’s work with the “Dover” will
give you a white spongy mass, pleasing alike
to eye and taste.</p>

<p>Wet a mould with cold water, put in the
sponge and set on ice until you are ready
to turn it out.</p>

<p>This is a delicious dessert. For pineapple
substitute strawberries, raspberries, or peaches.</p>


<h3>A Simple Susan.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of fine, dry bread crumbs.</p>

<p>Three cups of chopped apple.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of mace, and half as
much allspice.</p>

<p>Two teaspoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of salt.</p></div>

<p>Butter a pudding-dish and cover the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with crumbs. Lay on these a thick layer of
minced apple, sprinkled lightly with salt and
spices—more heavily with sugar. Stick bits
of butter over all. Then more crumbs, going
on in this order until all the ingredients are
used up. The top layer should be crumbs.
Cover closely, and bake half an hour. Remove
the cover and set on the upper grating
of the oven until nicely browned. Send to
table in the dish in which it was baked.</p>


<h3>Sauce for the Above.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cupfuls of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Half teaspoonful of mace or nutmeg.</p>

<p>Juice (strained) of a lemon.</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of boiling water.</p></div>

<p>Melt the butter with the hot water and
beat in, with egg whisk or “Dover,” the
sugar, a little at a time, until the sauce is
like a cream. Add lemon juice and nutmeg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
mould into a mound on a glass dish, or a
deep plate, and set in a cold place until it is
firm. This is a good “hard sauce” for any
hot pudding.</p>


<h3>Cottage Pudding.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two eggs.</p>

<p>One cup of milk.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Three cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>If you have not the prepared, use family
flour with two tablespoonfuls of baking
powder, sifted <i>twice</i> with it.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of salt.</p></div>

<p>Put the sugar in a bowl, warm the butter
slightly, but do not melt it, and rub it with a
wooden spoon into the sugar until they are
thoroughly mixed together. Beat the eggs
light in another bowl, stir in the sugar and
butter, then the milk, the salt, and lastly the
flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Butter a tin cake mould well, pour in
the batter and bake about forty minutes in a
steady oven.</p>

<p>Should it rise very fast, cover the top with
white paper as soon as a crust is formed, to
prevent scorching.</p>

<p>When you think it is done stick a clean,
dry straw into the thickest part. If it comes
up smooth and not sticky the loaf is ready
to be taken up.</p>

<p>Loosen the edges from the mould with a
knife, turn out on a plate, and send hot to
table. Cut with a keen blade into slices, and
eat with pudding sauce.</p>

<p>An easy receipt and one that seldom fails
to give general satisfaction.</p>

<h2>13<br />

<small>CAKE-MAKING.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NEVER undertake cake unless you are
willing to give to the business the
amount of time and labor needed to make it
<i>well</i>. Materials tossed together “anyhow”
may, once in a great while, come out right,
but the manufacturer has no right to expect
this, or to be mortified when the product is
a failure.</p>

<p>Before breaking an egg, or putting butter
and sugar together, collect all your ingredients.
Sift the flour and arrange close to your hand,
the bowls, egg-beater, cake-moulds, ready buttered,
etc.</p>

<p>Begin by putting the measured sugar into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
bowl, and working the butter into it with a
wooden spoon. Warm the butter slightly in
cold weather. Rub and stir until the mixture is
as smooth and light, as cream. Indeed, this
process is called “creaming.”</p>

<p>Now, beat the yolks of your eggs light and
thick in another bowl; wash the egg-beater
well, wipe dry and let it get cold before
whipping the whites to a standing heap in a
third vessel. Keep the eggs cool before and
while you beat them. Add the yolks to the
creamed butter and sugar, beating hard one
minute; put in the milk when milk is used,
the spices and flavoring; whip in the whites,
and lastly, the sifted and prepared flour.</p>

<p>Beat <i>from the bottom</i> of the mixing-bowl
with a wooden spoon, bringing it up full and
high with each stroke, and as soon as the ingredients
are fairly and smoothly mixed, stop
beating, or your cake will be tough.</p>

<p>Let your first attempt be with cup-cake
baked in small tins. Learn to manage your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
oven well before risking pound or fruit-cake.</p>

<p>Should the dough or batter rise very fast
lay white paper over the top, that this may
not harden into a crust before the middle is
done. To ascertain whether the cake is ready
to leave the oven, thrust a clean straw into
the thickest part. If it comes out clean, take
out the tins and set them <i>gently</i> on a table
or shelf to cool before turning them upside
down on a clean, dry cloth or dish.</p>


<h3>A Good Cup-cake.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One cup of butter.</p>

<p>Two cups of sugar—powdered.</p>

<p>Four eggs.</p>

<p>One cup of sweet milk.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>One half-teaspoonful of mace.</p>

<p>Three cups of prepared flour, or the same
quantity of family-flour with one even
teaspoonful of soda and two of cream-tartar,
sifted twice with it.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Two teaspoonfuls of baking powder will
serve the same end. Mix as directed in
“Practical Preliminaries,” and bake in small
tins.</p>


<h3>Jelly-cake</h3>

<p>Is made by mixing the above cup-cake, leaving
out the flavoring, and baking it in “jelly-cake
tins,” turning these out when almost
cold by running a knife around the edges,
and spreading all but that intended for the
top with a thick coating of fruit-jelly. Sift
white sugar over the upper one or frost it.</p>


<h3>Cream-cake.</h3>

<p>Mix a cup-cake without spice or other
flavoring, bake in jelly-cake tins, and when
cold spread between the layers this filling:</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One egg.</p>

<p>One cup of milk.</p>

<p>One half cup of sugar.</p>

<p>Two rounded teaspoonfuls of corn-starch.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of vanilla or other essence.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Scald the milk in a farina-kettle; wet the
cornstarch with a little cold milk and stir into
that over the fire until it thickens. Have the
egg ready whipped light into a bowl; beat it
in the sugar; pour the thick hot milk upon
this, gradually, stirring fast, return to the
kettle and boil (still stirring,) to a thick custard.
Let it cool before seasoning.</p>

<p>Frost the top-cake, or sift powdered sugar
over it.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut-cake.</h3>

<p>Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring
with rose-water.</p>

<p>Whip the whites of three eggs to a stiff
froth.</p>

<p>Add one cup of powdered sugar, and two
thirds of a grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>When the cakes are cold, spread between
the layers.</p>

<p>To the remaining third of the cocoanut add
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and cover
the top of the cake with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3>Apple-cake.</h3>

<p>Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring the
dough with essence of bitter almond.</p>

<p>Beat one egg light in a bowl, and into it a
cup of sugar. Add to this the strained juice
and grated rind of a lemon.</p>

<p>Peel and grate three fine pippins or other ripe,
tart apples directly into this mixture, stirring
each well in before adding another. When all
are in, put into a farina-kettle and stir over
the fire until the apple-custard is boiling hot
and quite thick. Cool and spread between the
cakes. A nice and simple cake. Eat the day
it is baked.</p>


<h3>Chocolate-cake.</h3>

<p>Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring
with vanilla. For filling, whip the whites of
three eggs stiff; stir in one cup and a half
of sugar and four tablespoonfuls of Baker’s
Vanilla Chocolate, grated. Beat hard for two
minutes and spread between the layers and on
the top of the cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3>White Cup-cake.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One cup of butter.</p>

<p>Two cups of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Three cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>One cup of sweet milk.</p>

<p>Whites of five eggs.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of essence of bitter
almond.</p></div>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add milk and beat
hard before putting in the whites of the eggs.
Stir in flavoring and, lightly and quickly, the
prepared flour. Bake in small tins.</p>


<h3>Frosting for Cake.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Whites of three eggs.</p>

<p>Three cups of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Strained juice of a lemon.</p></div>

<p>Put the whites into a <i>cold</i> bowl and add the
sugar at once, stirring it in thoroughly. Then
whip with your egg-beater until the mixture is
stiff and white, adding lemon-juice as you go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on. Spread thickly over the cake, and set in
the sun, or in a warm room to dry.</p>


<h3>White Lemon Cake.</h3>

<p>Make “white cup-cake,” bake in jelly cake-tins
and let it get cold. Prepare a frosting as
above directed, but use the juice of two
lemons and the grated peel of one. Spread
this mixture between the cakes and on the
top.</p>


<h3>Sponge Cake.</h3>

<p>Do not attempt this until you have had
some practice in the management of ovens,
and let your first trial be with what are sometimes
termed “snow-balls,”—that is, small
sponge cakes, frosted. Put six eggs into a
scale and ascertain their weight <i>exactly</i>.
Allow for the sponge cake the weight of the
eggs in sugar, and half their weight in flour.
Grate the yellow peel from a lemon and
squeeze the juice upon it. Let it stand ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
minutes, and strain through coarse muslin,
pressing out every drop.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks of the eggs very light and
then the sugar into them; the lemon-juice;
the whites, which should have been whipped to
a standing froth;—finally, stir in the sifted
flour swiftly and lightly. Bake in a steady
oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, glancing
at them now and then, to make sure
they are not scorching, and covering with
white paper as they harden on top.</p>

<p>This is an easy, and if implicitly obeyed, a
sure receipt.</p>


<h3>Nice Gingerbread.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Three eggs.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One cup each of molasses, “loppered” or
buttermilk, and of butter.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of ground ginger, a
teaspoonful of cinnamon, and half as
much allspice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Four and a half <i>full</i> cups of sifted
flour.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
tablespoonful of boiling water.</p></div>

<p>Put butter, molasses, sugar and spice in
a bowl, set in a pan of hot water and
stir with a wooden spoon until they are like
brown cream. Take from the water and add
the milk. Beat yolks and whites together until
light in another bowl, and turn the brown
mixture gradually in upon them, keeping the
egg-beater going briskly.</p>

<p>When well-mixed, add the soda, at last, the
flour. Beat <i>hard</i> three minutes, and bake
in well-buttered pans.</p>


<h3>Sugar Cookies.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of sugar.</p>

<p>One cup of butter.</p>

<p>Three eggs, whites and yolks beaten
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p><i>About</i> three cups of flour sifted with one
teaspoonful of baking powder.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of nutmeg, and half this
quantity of cloves.</p></div>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, beat in the
whipped eggs and spice; add a handful at a
time the flour, working it in until the dough
is stiff enough to roll out. Flour your hands
well and sprinkle flour over a pastry-board.
Make a ball of the dough, and lay it on the
board. Rub your rolling-pin also with flour
and roll out the dough into a sheet about a
quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Cut into round cakes; sift granulated sugar
over each and bake quickly.</p>


<h3>Ginger Snaps.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Two cups of molasses.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One cup of butter.</p>

<p>Five cups of flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>One heaping teaspoonful of ground ginger,
and the same quantity of allspice.</p></div>

<p>Stir molasses, sugar and butter together in
a bowl set in hot water, until <i>very</i> light.
Mix in spices and flour, and roll out as
directed in last receipt, but in a thinner
sheet. Cut into small cakes and bake quickly.</p>

<p>All cakes in the composition of which
molasses is used, are more apt to burn than
others. Watch your ginger snaps well, but
opening the oven as little as may be.</p>

<p>These spicy and toothsome cakes are better
the second day than the first, and keep well
for a week or more.</p>

<h2>14<br />

<small>JELLIES, CREAMS AND OTHER FANCY DISHES FOR
TEA AND LUNCHEON OR SUPPER-PARTIES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE pleasing custom in many families is
to make the daughters responsible for
“fancy cookery.” Mamma turns naturally, when
company is expected, to her young allies for
the manufacture of cake, jellies, blanc-mange,
etc., and for the arrangement of fruit and
flowers, and seldom cavils at the manner in
which they do the work.</p>

<p>The difference in the appointment of feasts
in houses where there are girls growing up
and grown, and in those where there are
none, is so marked that I need not call attention
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>Lemon or Orange Jelly.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One package of gelatine soaked in two
cups of cold water.</p>

<p>Two and a half cups of sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of four lemons and grated peel of
two (same of oranges).</p>

<p>Three cups of boiling water.</p>

<p>A quarter-teaspoonful powdered cinnamon.</p></div>

<p>Soak the gelatine two hours; add lemon
juice, grated peel, sugar and spice, and leave
for one hour. Pour on the boiling water, stir
until dissolved, and strain through double flannel.
Do not shake or squeeze, but let the
jelly filter clearly through it into a bowl or
pitcher set beneath. Wet moulds in cold water
and set aside to cool and harden.</p>


<h3>Ribbon Jelly.</h3>

<p>Take one third currant jelly, one third lemon
jelly, and as much plain blanc-mange. (<i>See
Desserts.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>When all are cold and begin to form, wet
a mould, pour in about a fourth of the red
jelly and set on the ice to harden; keep the
rest in a warm room, or near the fire. So
soon as the jelly is firm in the bottom of the
mould, add carefully some of the white blanc-mange,
and return the mould to the ice.
When this will bear the weight of more jelly,
add a little of the lemon, and when this
forms, another line of white.</p>

<p>Proceed in this order, dividing the red from
the yellow by white, until the jellies are used
up. Leave the mould on ice until you are
ready to turn the jelly out.</p>

<p>A pretty dish, and easily managed if one
will have patience to wait after putting in each
layer until it is firm enough not to be disturbed
or muddied by the next supply.</p>


<h3>Buttercup Jelly.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One half package of gelatine soaked in half
a cup of cold water for two hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Three eggs.</p>

<p>One pint of milk.</p>

<p>One heaping cup of sugar.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Bit of soda the size of a pea stirred into
the milk.</p></div>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding in a farina-kettle
and stir in the soaked gelatine until the latter
is dissolved, and strain through a coarse cloth.
Beat the yolks of the eggs light, add the sugar
and pour the boiling mixture gradually upon
it, stirring all the time.</p>

<p>Return to the farina-kettle and stir three
minutes, or until it begins to thicken. Let
it cool before you flavor it. Whip the white
of one egg stiff, and when the yellow jelly
coagulates around the edges, set the bowl
containing the frothed white in cracked ice or
in ice-water and beat the jelly into it, spoonful
by spoonful, with the egg-whip, until it is
all in and your sponge thick and smooth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Wet a mould and set it on the ice to form.
Lay about the base when you dish it.</p>


<h3>Whipped Cream.</h3>

<p>I have been assured by those who have
made the experiment, that excellent whipped
cream can be produced, and very quickly, by
the use of our incomparable Dover Egg-beater.
I have never tried this, but my pupils may,
if they have not a syllabub-churn.</p>

<p>Put a pint of rich, sweet cream in a pail or
other wide-mouthed vessel with straight sides,
and set in ice while you whip or churn it.</p>

<p>As the frothing cream rises to the top, remove
it carefully with a spoon and lay it in
a perfectly clean and cold colander, or on a
hair sieve, set over a bowl. If any cream
drips from it return to the vessel in which it
is whipped to be beaten over again. When
no more froth rises, whip a tablespoonful of
powdered sugar into the white syllabub in the
colander, and it is ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>Swan’s Down Cream.</h3>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>One pint of whipped cream.</p>

<p>Whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff
froth.</p>

<p>One cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful essence bitter almond.</p></div>

<p>Just before you are ready to send the dish
to table, beat whipped cream, frothed whites,
sugar and flavoring together in a bowl set deep
in cracked ice. Heap in a glass dish and
leave in the ice until it is to be eaten.</p>

<p>Send sponge cake around with it.</p>


<h3>Jellied Oranges.</h3>

<p>Cut a small round piece from the blossom
end of each of six or eight oranges, and scoop
out the pulp very carefully, so as not to widen
the hole, or tear the inside of the fruit. Use
your fingers and a small teaspoon for this
purpose until the oranges are empty and
clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay them then in very cold water while you
prepare with the pulp and juice you have
taken out, and the grated peel of another
orange, half the quantity of orange-jelly called
for by the receipt for lemon jelly. When it
is quite cold, fill the orange-skins with it, and
set in a cold place to harden.</p>

<p>In serving them, cut the oranges cross-wise
with a <i>sharp</i> knife and arrange in a glass dish,
the open sides upward. A few orange, lemon,
or japonica leaves to line the edges of the
dish, will give a pretty effect.</p>


<h3>Ambrosia.</h3>

<p>Peel fine, sweet oranges, and cut into small
pieces, extracting the seeds. Put a layer in a
glass dish and sprinkle well with sugar. In
this scatter a thick coating of grated cocoanut,
strewing this also with powdered sugar.
Over the cocoanut lay thin slices of bananas,
peeled and cut crosswise. Fill the dish in this
order, the top being covered with banana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>A nice dessert for Sundays and warm
afternoons when one dreads the heat of the
stove.</p>


<h3>How to make Coffee and Tea.</h3>

<p>If you wish to have really strong coffee,
allow a cup of freshly-ground coffee to a quart
of boiling water. Put the coffee in a bowl
and wet with half a cup of cold water. Stir
in the white and shell of a raw egg, and
turn into a clean, newly-scalded coffee-boiler.
Shut down the top and shake hard up and
down half a dozen times before pouring in
the boiling water. Set where it will boil hard,
but not run over, for twenty minutes, draw to
the side of the range and check the boil suddenly
by pouring in a third of a cup of cold
water. Let it stand three minutes to settle,
and pour off gently into the pot which is to
be set on the table.</p>

<p>Scald the milk to be drunk with coffee,
unless you can serve really rich cream with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<h3>Tea.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">First rule.</span> The water should boil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second rule.</span> The water in which the tea
is steeped, must be boiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third rule.</span> The water used for filling the
pot must be boiling.</p>

<p>I speak within bounds when I say that I
could tell on the fingers of my two hands the
tables at which I have drunk really good, hot,
fresh tea. Sometimes it is made with boiling
water, then allowed to simmer on the range
or hob until the decoction is rank, reedy and
bitter. Sometimes too little tea is put in, and
the beverage, while hot enough, is but faintly
colored and flavored.</p>

<p>Oftenest of all, the tea is made with unboiled
water, or with water that did boil
once, but is now flat and many degrees below
the point of ebullition.</p>

<p>Scald the china, or silver, or tin teapot from
which the beverage is to flow directly into
the cups; put in an even teaspoonful of tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for each person who is to partake of it, pour
in a half-cup of boiling water and cover the
pot with a cozy or napkin for five minutes.
Then, fill up with boiling <i>water from the kettle</i>
and take to the table. Fill the cups within
three minutes or so and you have the fresh
aroma of the delicious herb.</p>

<div class="author">ALLEN (Willis Boyd).</div>


<p><b>PINE CONES.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.00.</p>

<p>“Pine Cones sketches the adventures
of a dozen wide-awake boys and girls in
the woods, along the streams and over
the mountains. It is good, wholesome
reading that will make boys nobler and
girls gentler. It has nothing of the over-goody
flavor, but they are simply honest,
live, healthy young folks, with warm
blood in their veins and good impulses
in their hearts, and are out for a good
time. It will make old blood run warmer
and revive old times to hear them whoop
and see them scamper. No man or
woman has a right to grow too old to
enjoy seeing the young enjoy the spring
days of life. It is a breezy, joyous, entertaining
book, and we commend it to
our young readers.”—<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>


<p><b>SILVER RAGS</b>, 12mo, illustrated, 1.00.</p>

<p>“Silver Rags is a continuation of
Pine Cones and is quite as delightful
reading as its predecessor. The story
describes a jolly vacation in Maine, and
the sayings and doings of the city boys
and girls are varied by short stories, supposed
to be told by a good-natured ‘Uncle
Will.’”—<i>The Watchman</i>, Boston.</p>

<p>“Mr. Willis Boyd Allen is one of our
finest writers of juvenile fiction. There
is an open frankness in Mr. Allen’s
characters which render them quite as
novel as they are interesting, and his
simplicity of style makes the whole story
as fresh and breezy as the pine woods
themselves.”—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>


<p><b>THE NORTHERN CROSS.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.00.</p>

<p>“The Northern Cross, a story of the
Boston Latin School by Willis Boyd
Allen, is a capital book for boys. Beginning
with a drill upon Boston Common,
the book continues with many incidents
of school life. There are recitations,
with their successes and failures,
drills and exhibitions. Over all is Dr.
Francis Gardner, the stern, eccentric,
warm-hearted Head Master, whom once
to meet was to remember forever! The
idea of the Northern Cross for young
crusaders gives an imaginary tinge to the
healthy realism.”—<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Willis Boyd Allen appeals to a
large audience when he tells a story of
the Boston Latin School in the last year
of Master Gardner’s life. And even to
those who never had the privilege of
studying there the story is pleasant and
lively.”—<i>Boston Post.</i></p>


<p><b>KELP: A Story of the Isle of Shoals.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.00.</p>

<p>This is the latest of the Pine Cone Series and introduces the same characters. Their
adventures are now on a lonely little island, one of the Shoals, where they camp out
and have a glorious time not unmarked by certain perilous episodes which heighten
the interest of the story. It is really the best of a series of which all are delightful
reading for young people.</p>

<p>“It is a healthful, clean, bright book,
which will make the blood course healthfully
through the veins of young readers.”—<i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean.</i></p>



<div class="author">ANAGNOS (Julia R.).</div>


<p><b>PHILOSOPHIÆ QUÆSTOR;</b> or, Days at Concord. 12mo,
60 cents.</p>

<p>In this unique book, Mrs. Julia R. Anagnos, one of the accomplished daughters of
Julia Ward Howe, presents, under cover of a pleasing narrative, a sketch of the
Emerson session of the Concord School of Philosophy. It has for its frontispiece an
excellent picture of the building occupied by this renowned school.</p>

<p>“The seeker of philosophical truth,
who is described as the shadowy figure of
a young girl, is throughout very expressive
of desire and appreciation. The impressions
she receives are those to which
such a condition are most sensitive—the
higher and more refined ones—and the
responsive thoughts concern the nature
and character of what is heard or felt.
Mrs. Anagnos has written a prose poem,
in which the last two sessions of the
Concord School of Philosophy, which
include that in memory of Emerson, and
its lecturers excite her feelings and inspire
her thought. It is sung in lofty strains
that resemble those of the sacred woods
and fount, and themselves are communicative
of their spirit. It will be welcomed
as an appropriate souvenir.”—<i>Boston
Globe.</i></p>

<div class="author">KNIGHT (Charles).</div>


<p><b>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</b>, 12mo, 1.50. (3)</p>

<p>“The author discusses in a clear and
masterly way the relation between capital
and labor, the duties of employer and
employed, and the great advantage to
each that a thorough knowledge of their
work gives, and urges a broader culture
for all classes.”—<i>St. Joseph Gazette.</i></p>



<div class="author">KNIGHT (Mrs. S. G.).</div>


<p><b>NED HARWOOD’S VISIT TO JERUSALEM.</b> 4to,
boards, illustrated, 1.25. <i>Library Edition</i>, 12mo, cloth, 1.25.</p>

<p>The travellers were in no hurry. They spent much time in the places associated
with Christ’s ministry and in the former homes of the patriarchs and prophets. The
book is of especial value to Sunday-school teachers and scholars, because of the light
it throws upon many difficult Scripture passages by its vivid descriptions. The manuscript
was approved by Rev. Selah Merrill, D. D., for many years U. S. Consul at
Jerusalem. The strictest accuracy has thus been secured without impairing the interest
of the story. Cover in colors from original design.</p>

<p>“The pictures of buildings and scenery
are worth the price of the book.”—<i>Woman’s
Journal.</i></p>

<p>“It tells about just the things that
would interest a boy in the Holy Land.”—<i>Union
Signal.</i></p>



<div class="author">KOKHANOVSKY (Madame).</div>


<p><b>RUSTY LINCHPIN and LUBOFF ARCHIPOVNA.</b></p>

<p>Translated from the Russian by M. M. S. and J. L. E. 12mo, 1.25.</p>

<p>“Here are two exquisite idyls of Russian
rural life. Innocent and ingenuous,
ignorant of the falsity and fever of fashionable
life, they have the freshness and
simplicity of a good child. The local
coloring adds to their bright cheerfulness,
and the honest, kindly characters move
us to a devout thankfulness.”—<i>Christian
Union</i>, N. Y.</p>

<p>“They bring us very close to that
strange civilization which has lately become
so fascinating to Western readers,
and help us to realize how truly the aims
and the emotions of common life are the
same under all garbs and in all lands.”—<i>Chicago
Dial.</i></p>

<p>“Of a number of works of fiction
translated from the Russian within a year
or two, no book, as a whole, is so purely
reflective of Russian domestic life, or so
sweet in tone as ‘The Rusty Linchpin.’”—<i>Boston
Globe.</i></p>



<div class="author">LAMB (Charles).</div>

<p>“Seeking his materials for the most part in the common paths of life—often in the
humblest—he gives an importance to everything and sheds a grace over all.”—<span class="smcap">Thomas
Noon Talfourd.</span></p>


<p><b>A DISSERTATION UPON ROAST PIG.</b> Small quarto,
illustrated, 1.00.</p>

<p>A separate issue of the humorous masterpiece of Lamb, “the frolic and the gentle.”
Printed on heavy paper, in clear, large type, characteristically illustrated by L. J.
Bridgman.</p>

<p>“A little holiday book, the outside of
which is in admirable harmony with what
it contains. The dissertation is one of
those charming literary trifles, whose
lightness and brightness will always keep
it popular.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<div class="author">ADAMS (Emily).</div>


<p><b>SIX MONTHS AT MRS. PRIOR’S.</b> Illustrated. 12mo,
1.00 (4)</p>

<p>“A widow, with scanty means, makes
a home happy for a group of children.
The mother’s love holds them, her thrift
cares for them, her firmness restrains,
and her Christian words and life win
them to noble aims and living. The influence
of the Christian household is
widely felt, and the quiet transforming
leaven works in many homes.”—<i>The
United Presbyterian.</i></p>



<div class="author">ADAMS (Dr. Nehemiah).</div>

<p>12 vols., 12mo.</p>

<p>It is the charm of Dr. Adams’ style that truth, fitted by its profoundness to the
most thoughtful hearers, is made clear to the most illiterate. Few men have adorned
the American pulpit with a broader reach in adaptation to different classes of mind.</p>

<p><b>POST-LAUREATE IDYLS AND OTHER POEMS.</b>
16mo, cloth, gilt top, 1.00; vegetable parchment, 1.50.</p>

<p>The Post-Laureate Idyls are ten parodies of Tennyson’s “Idyls of the King”
whose themes are taken from Mother Goose Melodies. The Other Poems are “A
Tale of Tuscany,” “The Legend of the Golden Lotus,” fifteen lyrics and eight
sonnets.</p>

<p>“The dexterity and cleverness with
which Mr. Adams has made the old
rhymes serve his turn is amazing. The
humor is delicate and unfailing throughout,
while the verse is smooth and flowing,
with graceful and liquid cadence.
Mr. Adams is too truly a poet, however,
to deal in pure burlesque, and there runs
through all the pleasantry of these pages
a touch of sadness, like the echo of the
pain of the lays they travesty. They
could not be better done. The lyrics and
sonnets which end the volume are marked
by sweetness and delicacy.”—<span class="smcap">Arlo

<div class="author">BEDSIDE POETRY.</div>

<p>Edited by Wendell P. Garrison. 16mo, plain cloth, .75; fancy
cloth, 1.00.</p>

<p>This collection is for the home, and for a particular season. “Few fathers and
mothers,” says Mr. Garrison, “appreciate the peculiar value of the bedtime hour for
confirming filial and parental affection, and for conveying reproof to ears never so
attentive or resistless. Words said then sink deep, and the reading of poetry of a
high moral tone and, at the same time, of an attractive character, is apt to plant seed
which will bear good fruit in the future.”</p>

<p>“There is seldom a compilation of
verse at once so wisely limited and so
well extended, so choice in character and
so fine in quality as Bedside Poetry, edited
by Wendell P. Garrison. He has
chosen four-score pieces ‘of a rather high
order, the remembrance of which will be
a joy forever and a potent factor in the
formation not merely of character but of
literary taste.’ Therefore he has given
Emerson and Cowper, Wordsworth,
Leigh Hunt, Shelley, Southey, Coleridge,
William Blake, Burns, Thackeray,
Lowell, Tennyson, Shakespeare, Mrs.
Hemans, Mrs. Kemble, Holmes, Whittier
and Arthur Hugh Clough. We find
cheer and courage, truth and fortitude,
purity and humor, and all the great positive
virtues, put convincingly in these
selections.”—<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p><b>IN WAR-TIMES AT LA ROSE BLANCHE</b>, 12mo,
illustrations by Kemble, 1.25.</p>

<p>“‘In War-Times at La Rose Blanche,’
by M. E. M. Davis, is one of those
charming books so naturally written that
the reader feels as if he himself had lived
its scenes, had heard the little ‘Cunnel’s
vally’ ask, ‘Marse Jim, has you seen
marster?’ had watched the fortunes of
the dish-rag bonnet, had seen the four
lads with their bran-new uniforms start
proudly off for the War, and seen them
thin and ragged return to feast off ‘po’
souls.’ It has always seemed to us that
a book like this, with its sketchy tender
touches here and there of humor, joy and
grief, is far more ‘realistic’ than a novel.”—<i>Critic</i>,
N. Y.</p>

<p>“The whole book in its truth and tenderness
is like one of its own pictures—a
morning-glory growing on a soldier-boy’s
grave.”—<i>New York Nation.</i></p>

<p>“The author writes with a graceful
pen, with a sweet, half-humorous simplicity
and lightness of touch that makes
the work a constant delight. And the
feeling is so true, the humor so bright,
the pathos so appealing, though never
insistent, that the book is almost perfection.”—<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“The really good book of Southern
war stories for children waited until it
appeared in the shape of ‘In War-Times.’
It is all there; it is all in the little book
with its twelve stories, some gay and
some sad, and its delightful tale of doll-housekeeping,
and if there be any child,
or, indeed, any older reader who will not
cry over the ‘Cunnel’s Vally’ let North
and South both reject him. ‘’Twas a
long, long time on de way’ but ‘La Rose
Blanche’ means that the good time for
the children is here and that the Southern
side of the war story is going to be written
for them.”—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

power of clear-cut statement which,
in an instructor, whether he wields the

qualification for success. In this respect
her style reminds us of that of Mr. Nordhoff

vivacity and vigor which are necessary for
an interesting story, and pervaded with
true Christian love that gives it value. A
young girl comes into a farmer’s family,
provided only with the motto, ‘Seek daily
opportunities of doing good,’ and a sweet
affectionate nature to carry out the motto.
Her influence upon a narrow household,
in which darning and earning are the chief
aims, is developed with much good taste

The heroine of the present book is the
daughter of a clergyman, ‘a girl who was
neither all good nor all bad, but partly the
one and partly the other’; and the narrative
of her trials and experiences is intended

<p>“The Cherry-Blooms of Yeddo fall
upon us in the form of a snow-shower of
flowers and petals of genuine poetry. A
half dozen of the thirty or more poems cast
a mystic glow upon native and missionary
life in Japan. ‘The Baptism’ and
‘Easter’ are exquisitely touching, and
illustrative of Christ’s conquest over the
pagan heart, and of the sad but silver-edged
experience of the missionary who
comes back to home-land bereft, but not
with Naomi’s hopeless and rebellious
grief.”—<i>Christian Intelligencer</i>, New

<p>“There is about them all a simplicity

<p><b>POSSIBILITIES.</b> 12mo, 1.25.</p>

<p>The author gives at the opening the picture of a country village school which,
through lack of tact and knowledge on the part of teachers and of interest on the
part of parents, had become almost worthless. A new teacher, with a mind and
method of her own, is engaged for a term, and she sets at work with a determination
to revolutionize the existing condition of things. It requires a good deal of tact and
management to enlist parents and pupils in her plans, but she does it by quiet persistence,
and the end of the term sees not only a remarkable change in the school, but in
the village itself.</p>

<p>“As a general rule novels with a purpose
are dry reading. There are brilliant
exceptions, however, and one of these is
‘Possibilities.’”—<i>Albany Argus.</i></p>


<p><b>ONLY ME.</b> 12mo, 1.25.</p>

these rounds on a snowy night, a good-hearted
watchman finds a little fellow
half starved and half frozen, crouched
against the little sentry-box in which he
himself found shelter between his rounds.
The boy is taken home by the watchman,
and the story follows him through early
years and through his experience as bound
boy on a farm, and his subsequent starting
in life in a store in the city where he
rises to be confidential clerk and at last
partner in the firm.”—<i>National Baptist</i>,

<p>A Brief memoir tells the story of the short life of the young poet.</p>

<p>“The author of these poems was
possessed of the rarest loveliness of person
and character, and she has left behind
her a memory fragrant with blessing.
Her verse was the natural outcome of
her beautiful soul; its exceeding delicacy
and sweetness are sufficient to charm all
who have the answering sentiment to
which it appeals.”—<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>

light shine whenever and wherever they
can. The girls vary greatly, but each
one is determined to do her best with the
material that the Lord has given her.
Their several successes and failures are
told, and many lessons are drawn from
their work.”—<i>Golden Rule</i>, Boston.</p>

<p><b>SEVEN EASTER LILIES.</b> 12mo, 1.25.</p>

<p>A story for girls, pure, sweet, and full of encouragement, and calculated to exert a
strong influence for good. The author feels that there is something peculiarly
sacred and tender about Easter lilies, partly, perhaps, from their association with the
day and season whose name they bear. The story tells what became of seven lilies
which were tended by as many different hands in different homes, and how they
affected those homes by the silent lessons they taught.</p>

accurately what the babies like to look
at in the way of pictures, and what they
like to have read to them in the way of
stories. And that is why Babyland is
what it is, and why it appeals so strongly
to little eyes and little ears.”—<i>Boston
Transcript.</i></p>

<p>“A handsome illustrated book. The
illustrations are as artistic as if made for
older and more critical readers. We have
got away from the old idea that anything
is good enough for children and now
demand for them the best in art and
literature. That is the best way to educate
them into the best.”—<i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>“It is filled with good things that will
make the children merrier and happier.”—<i>Philadelphia
Star.</i></p>

<p>“What a help and blessing for the
tired mother.”—<i>Farm, Field and Stockman</i>,
Chicago.</p>

<p><b>ROUND THE WORLD LETTERS.</b> 12mo, illustrated,
1.50.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bainbridge’s work is a book
for all classes of readers, young or old,
serious or gay. The reader will never
forget that his cicerone “round the
world” is a Christian woman, while
such is the charm of her style every
reader is fascinated. The book is a brilliant
photograph of the experiences and
observations of an intelligent woman in
such a variety of scenes as such a tour as
she made implies. The writer is a keen
observer, and has had exceptional facilities
for intelligent observation. The
reader will feel that he has gained a wonderfully
clear notion of the whole living
and breathing world, while yet he has
been fascinated and entertained as few
romances could do it.”—<i>The Watchman.</i></p>

<p><b>AROUND THE WORLD TOUR OF CHRISTIAN
MISSIONS.</b> 8vo, illustrated with maps, 2.00.</p>

<p>“A universal survey of home and
foreign evangelization, compiled from
personal study upon the field of many
lands and from conference with over a
thousand missionaries. Several maps
locate all leading mission stations of all
denominations of all Protestant lands....
No work in this line, so complete
and so reliable has ever been published
in America, England or Europe.”—<i>Golden
Rule</i>, Boston.</p>


<p><b>SELF-GIVING.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.50.</p>

<p>A story of Christian missions.</p>

<p>“The growth of missionary spirit, the
strength of character by overcoming difficulties,
the glory of consecration, the
beauty of sacrifice, the blessed results of
intelligent work, run through the fiction
like bright streams through flowery meadows,
and like reptiles among flowers, we
see in midst of sacrifices the repulsive
spirit of the world and selfishness among
missionaries, in self-seeking secretaries,
in adventurers under cloak of missionary
zeal, in the meanness of gifts and inappreciation
of the work.”—<i>Our Churchman at Work</i>, Brooklyn.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
